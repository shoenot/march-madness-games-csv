The '''2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament''' involved 65 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] that determined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[College basketball|basketball]] national champion for the [[2008–09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2008–09 season]]. The 71st annual edition of the tournament began on March 17, 2009, and concluded with the [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 6 at [[Ford Field]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].

The University of North Carolina defeated [[2008–09 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]] to become the champion. It was the Tar Heels 5th title, and 2nd under [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]]. The 2009 tournament was the first time the Final Four had a minimum seating capacity of 70,000, and by having most of the tournament in the February Sweeps of the Nielsen Ratings due to the [[digital television transition in the United States]] on June 12, 2009, this was the last NCAA basketball tournament, in all three divisions, to air on analog television.

Prior to the start of the tournament, the top ranked team was [[2008–09 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]] in both the [[AP Top 25]] and the [[Coaches' Poll|ESPN/USA Today Coaches']] Polls, followed by [[2008-09 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]], [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]], and [[2008–09 Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball team|Pittsburgh]].<ref>[https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/rankings?seasonYear=2009 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball Rankings (Mar. 16) on ESPN.com]</ref> Only the Tar Heels of North Carolina were the regional winners and played in the Final Four. The Tar Heels completed one of the most dominant runs in the tournament's history by winning each of their games by at least twelve points.

For the first time since seeding began, all #1–#3 seeds made it into the Sweet 16, and for the third consecutive time, all #1 seeds made the Elite Eight.

Four schools made their NCAA tournament debut, all respective conference champions: Binghamton (America East), Morgan State (MEAC), Stephen F. Austin (Southland), and North Dakota State (Summit), a school in its first season of Division I eligibility.

==Tournament procedure==
{{further|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Tournament format}}
Sixty-five teams were selected for the tournament. Thirty of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournaments. The automatic bid of the [[Ivy League]], which does not conduct a postseason tournament, went to [[2008–09 Cornell Big Red men's basketball team|Cornell]], its regular season champion. The remaining 34 teams were granted "at-large" bids by the NCAA Selection Committee.

Two teams play an opening-round game, popularly called the "[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round Game|play-in game]]". The winner of that game advances to the main draw of the tournament as a 16 seed and plays a top seed in one of the regionals. The 2009 game was played on Tuesday, March 17, at the [[University of Dayton Arena]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], as it has since its inception in [[2001 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2001]].

All 64 teams were seeded 1 to 16 within their regions; the winner of the play-in game automatically received a 16 seed. The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] seeded the entire field from 1 to 65. SEC commissioner [[Michael Slive]] served his last year as chairman of the committee.

==Game summaries==

===Midwest Region===
[[Goran Suton]] of Michigan State was the Midwest regional most outstanding player.  He was joined by Spartan teammates [[Kalin Lucas]] and [[Travis Walton (basketball)|Travis Walton]], Louisville's [[Earl Clark]] and Kansas's [[Cole Aldrich]] on the NCAA tournament All-Midwest Regional team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wibw.com/sports/headlines/42097582.html|title=Kansas Center Cole Aldrich Named to NCAA Tournament All-Midwest Regional Team|access-date=2009-03-31|date=2009-03-29|publisher=[[WIBW-TV|WIBW]]|archive-date=2011-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724082312/http://www.wibw.com/sports/headlines/42097582.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====First round====
To play the top-seeded Louisville Cardinals in the first round, Morehead State defeated Alabama State 58–43, with the Eagles keeping the Hornets without a lead the entire game. This marked the first time either team had played in the tournament in five years; the Eagles had not played since 1984.<ref>{{cite web |title=Morehead St. earns matchup with Louisville in tourney|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=290762011 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090323175709/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=290762011| archive-date= 23 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref> Morehead State fell to Louisville 74–54, the 100th time a 1 seed beat a 16 seed in the tournament since seeding began. However, the Eagles managed to keep the game close until halftime, when Louisville led by only 2 points. In the second half, the Cardinals began to apply their signature fullcourt pressure, forcing turnovers and outscoring Morehead State 22–6 at the beginning of the half. Leon Buchanan's 17 points for the Eagles were not enough to upset Louisville, whose top scorers, [[Samardo Samuels]] and [[Terrence Williams]], scored a combined 28 points. Morehead State has not beaten Louisville in 52 years until [[2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2011]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Louisville applies pressure in second half to cruise past Morehead State|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000047 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005535/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000047| archive-date= 25 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

In two overtimes, the Siena Saints beat the Ohio State Buckeyes 74–72. Ohio State had the advantage of playing an hour from their campus, and received 25 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists from [[Evan Turner]]. The Saints made 6 out of 23 3-pointers and had 22 turnovers. Accordingly, Siena trailed for most of the game, but scored the last four points in regulation to force overtime. At the end of the first overtime, Siena's Ronald Moore drained his first 3-pointer to force a second overtime. With 3.9 seconds left in that overtime, he hit a second three from the same location to give the Saints a late 2-point lead. In an attempt to send the game into a third overtime, Turner shot a 15-footer immediately afterwards, but he missed it. This was Siena's fifth appearance in the tournament, after beating [[Vanderbilt University]] in 2008 as a 13 seed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Moore's clutch shots spur Siena by Ohio St. in 2OT|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000048 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005540/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000048| archive-date= 25 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

The Arizona-Utah matchup was not as close. The Fifth-seeded Utah Utes were upset by the twelfth-seeded Arizona Wildcats, one of the last teams to make it in the tournament and a questionable entry,<ref>{{cite web|title=Scouting Friday's Sweet 16 games – cleveland.com |date=March 27, 2009 |url=http://www.cleveland.com/marchmadness/index.ssf/2009/03/scouting_fridays_sweet_16_game.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921162858/http://www.cleveland.com/marchmadness/index.ssf/2009/03/scouting_fridays_sweet_16_game.html |archive-date=2009-09-21 |url-status=live |access-date=2009-05-31 }}</ref> by a score of 84–71. The Utes closed the lead to two with roughly five minutes left in the game, but the Wildcats' answer was a 10–1 run. Utah's [[Luke Nevill]] committed two fouls less than four minutes into the game and scored only 12 points. [[Nic Wise]] of Arizona, meanwhile, led the team with 29 points, with 21 in the second half. Tyler Kepkay led the Utes with a team 19 points in his embarking performance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wise's 21 after half propel Arizona past fifth-seeded Utah|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000050| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005545/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000050| archive-date= 25 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

The Cleveland State-Wake Forest game was an even larger upset. In their second bid in the tournament, the Cleveland State Vikings shocked the Wake Forest Demon Deacons 84–69. This 15-point win ties for third-greatest victory margin for a 13 seed over a 4 seed. Wake Forest, once ranked first in the country, had 16 turnovers in the matchup, compared to six for the Vikings. [[James Johnson (basketball, born 1987)|James Johnson]] of the Demon Deacons scored 22 points, although this could not compensate for a substandard offense. Their scoring leader, [[Jeff Teague (basketball)|Jeff Teague]], finished with 10 points, half his average. For these reasons, Wake Forest never obtained a lead, while Cleveland State sank three consecutive 3-pointers in the early minutes of the game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cleveland State races to early lead to knock out Wake Forest|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000051| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325085623/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000051| archive-date= 25 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

For the first time in 19 years, Dayton advanced to the second round of the tournament with a win over West Virginia 68–60. This also ended West Virginia's first-round winning streak, which had lasted since 1992. [[Chris Wright (basketball, born 1988)|Chris Wright]] led the Dayton Flyers with 27 points, a career high, while also chalking up 10 rebounds. [[Charles Little (basketball)|Charles Little]] also aided the Flyers with 18 points. [[Darryl Bryant]], who led West Virginia with 21 points, shot two consecutive three-pointers to bring Dayton's lead to 48–47 with 11:02 minutes left in the game. However, that was the closest the Mountaineers had to a lead outside the beginning of the game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flyers shake Huggins hex, take down sixth-seeded West Virginia|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000054| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090323143647/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000054| archive-date= 23 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

In their first eligible year, North Dakota State appeared in the tournament, facing defending champion Kansas. The three-seeded Kansas Jayhawks staved off the fourteenth-seeded Bison's upset bid with an 84–74 victory. [[Ben Woodside]] shined with 37 points for the Bison, his sixth game of the season with at least 30 points. However, [[Sherron Collins]] and [[Cole Aldrich]] proved too much for North Dakota State, accounting for 65 percent of the Jayhawks' points with 32 and 23 respectively.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kansas holds off North Dakota State as Collins pours in 32|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-03-31 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000055| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090323233521/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000055| archive-date= 23 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

The tenth-seeded USC Trojans demolished the seventh-seeded Boston College Eagles by a score of 72–55, helped by [[Taj Gibson]]'s 10-for-10 shooting from the field, tied for the second-best NCAA tournament field-goal shooting performance in history. He led the team with 24 points and recorded six rebounds, five assists, and three blocks. [[Dwight Lewis]] also added 20 points for the Trojans. After leading 34–30 at halftime, the Eagles scored just a single field goal during one 13-minute stretch, as part of a 23.1 shooting percentage in the second half.<ref>{{cite web |title=USC rolls as Gibson's 10-for-10 shooting leads to upset of Boston College|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-03-31|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000057| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005552/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000057| archive-date= 25 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

Robert Morris, the region's 15 seed, was blown away by second-seeded Michigan State 77–62. The game was tied with 4:44 left in the first half, but then the Colonials went almost 20 minutes without scoring a single point. The Spartans took advantage of this for a 21–0 run that sealed the game in their favor. The Colonials' Jeremy Chappell was the only team member to score double-digit points with 11, and he also led the team with six rebounds, two steals, and three blocks. [[Raymar Morgan]] was the Spartans' leading scorer with 16 points.<ref>{{cite web |title=Morgan, Michigan State bully Robert Morris in Midwest opener|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-04-02 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000058&confId=100|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713155515/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000058&confId=100|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 13, 2012}}</ref>

====Second round====
Ninth-seeded Siena faced top seed Louisville, with the Cardinals emerging victorious 79–72. Taking advantage of Louisville's 19 turnovers, the Saints came back from a 12-point deficit with 17:21 left in the game to snatch the lead around the 9-minute mark. [[Edwin Ubiles]] broke through Louisville's full-court pressure and added 24 points for Siena. [[Terrence Williams]], known as one of the most relaxed players on the Cardinals roster, saved his team by grabbing rebounds and making 3s. He led the team with 24 points, 15 rebounds, two steals, and four assists. [[Earl Clark]] also helped the Cardinals' cause with 12 points and 12 rebounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Louisville reaches 2nd straight Sweet 16 behind Williams' double-double|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-04-02 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000049| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090326083855/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000049| archive-date= 26 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

In a 12 vs. 13 seed Cinderella matchup, Arizona handily defeated Cleveland State. The Wildcats' zone defense puzzled Cleveland State, and their fast breaks sealed the game. The smallest deficit the Vikings faced was 48–44 about midway through the second half, though the Wildcats then went on a 13–2 run led by [[Nic Wise]]'s five consecutive points. His 21 points led the team's four double-digit scorers. Arizona was excellent behind the free-throw line, finishing 24 for 28.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wildcats reach final 16 for 12th time since '88|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-04-03 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000052| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325174609/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000052| archive-date= 25 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

[[Cole Aldrich]]'s [[triple-double]] with 13 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocked shots paved the way for a third-seeded Kansas win over 11 seed Dayton. This was only the sixth triple-double in NCAA tournament history. With 43 points, Dayton scored the fewest points they had all season, compared to Kansas's 60. Despite their small point total, the Flyers shot 72 times, its most all season, amounting to a 22.2 shooting percentage. The Jayhawks were also not having one of their better offensive games, with [[Sherron Collins]] being an exception; he made 25 points. This marked the third straight Sweet Sixteen appearance for Kansas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aldrich's 13 points, 20 boards, 10 blocked shots lead KU to Sweet 16 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-04-03 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000056| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090325110638/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000056| archive-date= 25 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

Playing the tenth-seeded [[USC Trojans]], second-seeded Michigan State utilized [[Travis Walton (basketball)|Travis Walton]]'s career-high 18 points for a 74–69 win. Normally known as a defensive player and averaging 4.9 points per game, Walton shot 8 for 13 from the field. His team out-rebounded USC 33 to 23, and USC made only one three-point play. Star Trojan [[Taj Gibson]] was in foul trouble throughout much of the game, and yet his teammates rallied for 14 lead changes and 16 ties. [[Dwight Lewis]], who gave a 19-point performance overall, scored six consecutive points for USC for a late tie. The Spartans only earned a victory after the Trojans missed their last nine shots. With the win, Michigan State has made it to the Sweet 16 eight times of the last 12 years, more than any other team except Duke.<ref>{{cite web |title=Walton's career-high 18 lift Spartans over USC, into Sweet 16|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-04-04 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000059| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090326085834/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000059| archive-date= 26 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

====Regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen)====
Louisville, the region's top seed, routed twelfth-seeded Arizona 103–64. In NCAA tournament history, this was Louisville's largest win and Arizona's largest loss. It was no surprise, given the Cardinals' 57.6 field goal percentage and their 48% shooting behind the arc. Their fullcourt pressure forced 15 turnovers on the Wildcats the entire game, including nine in the first half. [[Earl Clark]] led the Cardinals with 19 points, whose ballhandling garnered 29 assists. This was the most lopsided Sweet 16 victory since 1972.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cardinals fly into Elite 8 with one-sided victory over Wildcats|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-04-04 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000053| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090331100301/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000053| archive-date= 31 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

The Michigan State-Kansas matchup was much more intense. After overcoming a 13-point first half deficit, the Spartans won 67–62. They shot 16 of 17 from the foul line, and on their only miss they rebounded the ball and gave Raymar Morgan the only points of the night on a dunk. Such rallies in the second half narrowed the deficit and occasionally took the lead, although the Jayhawks responded and were up by 2 with 2 minutes left in the game. They were helped by [[Sherron Collins]] and [[Cole Aldrich]]'s combined 37 points. However, [[Kalin Lucas]] of the Spartans, who had scored 11 points in the first 39 minutes of the game, made seven straight points with 48 seconds left. [[Goran Suton]] also added nine rebounds, five steals, and a season-high 20 points for Michigan State.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lucas, Spartans eliminate Jayhawks with late free throws |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2009 |access-date=2009-04-04 |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000060| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090331101224/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000060| archive-date= 31 March 2009 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

====Regional final (Elite Eight)====
Michigan State defeated overall number one seed Louisville, 64–52, to advance to their fifth Final Four since 1999. Michigan State held Louisville to their second lowest point total of the season with their man-to-man defense keeping them out of sync all game. Center Goran Suton had 19 points and Durrel Summers had 12 in the rout. Earl Clark had 19 for Louisville.

====Second round====
[[Pac-10]] champions [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington Huskies]] scored 46 points in the second half, but it was not enough to beat the [[2008–09 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|Purdue Boilermakers]] in the second round of West Regional, falling short by two points (76–74). Leaders for Purdue were JaJuan Johnson with 22 points and Keaton Grant with 12 rebounds.

====Regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen)====
Connecticut faced Purdue at University of Phoenix Stadium in a West Regional semifinal.

In the nightcap of the sweet sixteen matchups, two sets of Tigers met, pitting Missouri against Memphis in a matchup that saw teams with similar fast-paced styles meet. Missouri was able to pull away with a 27–7 run that gave them a 64–40 lead. Though Memphis attempted to claw back into the game through [[Tyreke Evans]]' 33 points, it was JT Tiller, [[DeMarre Carroll]], and Leo Lyons  that moved on to meet UConn in the regional final along with the rest of their Missouri Tigers.

====Regional final (Elite Eight)====

Kemba Walker came off the UConn bench to spark them to a victory over the 3 seeded Missouri Tigers.

Top scorers in the game were [[Eric Maynor]] (21) for VCU and [[Josh Shipp (basketball)|Josh Shipp]] (16) for UCLA.

[[Villanova Wildcats]], playing at home against an [[American University]] team that featured 5 seniors, fell behind early as American hit a barrage of 3 pointers. However, in the 2nd half, Villanova was able to take advantage of 20 free throws in the final 13 minutes of the game to win against American.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090323103133/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=294000024 Anderson, Cunningham lead way as Villanova ousts upset-minded American]</ref>

No. 12 seed [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin]] upset #5 seed [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida St.]] 61–59 in OT. Down 31–19 at the half, the Badgers' [[Jason Bohannon]] made a three-point jumper to give Wisconsin the lead with 45 seconds left in regulation. Trevon Hughes fouled Toney Douglas, who made two free throws to send the game into over-time. In over-time, the Badgers trailed by one with just seconds left when Hughes made a twisting shot from the lane over two defenders to put the Badgers ahead 60–59. Hughes was also fouled on the shot, and made the resulting free throw to make the score 61–59.

===Final Four===
All final four teams in the tournament had won at least one national championship. Entering the tournament, North Carolina had the most, with four ([[1957 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1957]], [[1982 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1982]], [[1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1993]], [[2005 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2005]]); Connecticut had two; ([[1999 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1999]], [[2004 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2004]]); Michigan State also had two; ([[1979 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1979]], [[2000 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2000]]), and Villanova won one; ([[1985 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1985]]).

The Spartans had home court advantage by playing in their home state. Six teams have played the Final Four in their home states, but only four of them won. UCLA ([[1968 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1968]], [[1972 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1972]], [[1975 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1975]]) and North Carolina State ([[1974 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1974]]) won the national title, but Duke ([[1994 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1994]]) and Purdue ([[1980 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1980]]) lost in the Final Four. The biggest advantage came in 1968 and 1972 when UCLA played the championship game at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]], which is a short distance from [[Pauley Pavilion]], their home court since 1965.

[[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]], with 7 minutes to play, finally took hold of the game and defeated the number one seed [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]] to advance to the championship game against North Carolina. The Spartans started the game with a 7-point run, but the Huskies came back to take a lead in the first half. Michigan State took it back and was leading by two at the half. Connecticut had the lead twice early in the second period. Michigan State, led by guard [[Kalin Lucas]] with 21 points and forward [[Raymar Morgan]] with 18 points, was just too much at the end for the Huskies. Scoring for Connecticut was shared by [[Jeff Adrien]] (13), Stanley Robinson (15), [[Hasheem Thabeet]] (17) and A.J.

[[Ty Lawson]] produced 22 points, followed by [[Wayne Ellington]] with 20 points and [[Tyler Hansbrough]] with 18 points. Hansbrough, the sixth-leading scorer in tournament history, pulled down 11 rebounds. For [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]], who coached North Carolina to a national championship in 2005, it is back to the title game again.

==Media==

===Television===
Once again, except for the play-in game, which was telecast on [[ESPN]], [[CBS Sports|CBS]] and [[CBS College Sports Network]] served as broadcasters on television for the tournament. The only change from past years at the Final Four was that [[Jim Nantz]] worked with [[Clark Kellogg]] in the [[color commentary]] position instead of [[Billy Packer]], who left CBS in July 2008.

*[[RIKOARAKASHI]] AND [[JOHNNYZILLION]] AND [[Erika Padilla]] – First & Second Round at Dayton, Ohio; East Regional at Boston, Massachusetts

For the play-in game in Dayton, ESPN had [[Brent Musburger]], [[Steve Lavin]] and [[Erin Andrews]] working as the announcers.

Some CBS affiliates put additional game broadcasts on digital subchannels, or, as in the following two instances, on other stations:
*[[WOIO]] and [[WUAB-TV|WUAB]] ([[Raycom Media]] [[duopoly]]): On March 20, WOIO aired Ohio State vs. Siena, while Cleveland State vs. Wake Forest was on WUAB at the same time.  The [[Cleveland]] area has a substantial number of OSU alumni, and [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]], although part of the Cleveland market, is equidistant to both [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and Cleveland.
*[[KOTV-DT|KOTV]] and [[KQCW]] (Griffin Media duopoly): Also on March 20, KOTV aired Oklahoma State vs. Tennessee; at the same time, Kansas vs. North Dakota State was on KQCW.  The reason for this simulcast is that part of the Tulsa market includes [[Coffeyville, Kansas|Coffeyville]] and other communities at the southern end of Kansas.

===Radio===
[[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] was once again the radio home for the tournament.
