The '''2012 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 68 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] that determined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[College basketball|basketball]] national champion for the [[2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2011-12 season]]. The 74th edition of the tournament began on March 13, 2012, and concluded with the [[2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|championship game]] on April 2, at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]].

The Final Four consisted of [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]], making their second appearance in the Final Four under [[John Calipari]], [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]], making their second appearance under [[Rick Pitino]] and first since 2005, [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], making their first appearance since winning the 2008 national championship under head coach [[Bill Self]] by defeating Calipari's [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]] team, and [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]], making their first appearance since their runner-up finish in 2007 and second under coach [[Thad Matta]]. This was the first (and only) tournament that both national semifinals and the national championship game were regular season rematches.<ref>[https://www.espn.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post?id=57282 Davis, Withey will host block party in final] ESPN.com, April 1, 2012</ref> Kentucky defeated Kansas in the championship game 67–59 to win their first national championship since [[Tubby Smith]] led the team there in 1998. This was Calipari's first national championship in four trips to the Final Four, having previously gone there with Kentucky in 2011, Memphis in 2008 and [[UMass Minutemen men's basketball|Massachusetts]] in 1996.

Upsets were once again the story of the tournament in 2012, and for the first time ever two #15 seeds won in the same tournament. In the South Region, #15 [[Lehigh Mountain Hawks men's basketball|Lehigh]] of the [[Patriot League]] defeated #2 [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]. In the West Region, #15 [[Norfolk State Spartans men's basketball|Norfolk State]] of the [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference|MEAC]], making their first ever NCAA tournament appearance, defeated #2 [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri]] as a 21.5 point underdog, the second biggest upset in terms of point spread in NCAA tournament history, behind [[2023 Fairleigh Dickinson vs. Purdue men's basketball game|Fairleigh Dickinson's defeat of Purdue]] in [[2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2023]], where Purdue was a 23.5 point favorite.

In addition to this, [[Ohio Bobcats men's basketball|Ohio]] won a game as a double digit seed for the second time in four tournaments as the #13 seed Bobcats defeated #4 seed [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] to advance to the third round of the Midwest Region. A team from the First Four games also won in the Round of 64 for the second consecutive year as [[South Florida Bulls men's basketball|South Florida]] defeated Midwest #5 seed [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple]], setting up a #12 vs. #13 matchup that Ohio won.

[[VCU Rams men's basketball|Virginia Commonwealth]], a Final Four team from 2011 as an #11 seed, made the 2012 tournament as a #12 seed and once again made the round of 32 by defeating South #5 seed [[Wichita State Shockers men's basketball|Wichita State]]. The South Region saw four double digit seeds win in their opening games, as [[Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball|Colorado]] and [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] joined VCU and Lehigh as victors. Xavier advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they were defeated by [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]].

Despite the upsets, all four top seeds advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2009. Three made it to the Elite Eight, as only [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] of the West Region lost. Kentucky was the only one to advance to the Final Four as [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] lost in their regional finals. This would end up being the last Final Four until [[2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2019]] that did not include at least one team seeded #7 or higher, and still is the last Final Four to not include at least one team seeded #5 or higher as of the conclusion of the 2024 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-05-11/2013-ncaa-tournament-bracket-scores-stats-records|title=2013 NCAA tournament: Bracket, scores, stats, records &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com|accessdate=25 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-05-10/2014-ncaa-tournament-bracket-scores-stats-records|title=2014 NCAA tournament: Bracket, scores, stats, records &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com|accessdate=25 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-05-08/2015-ncaa-tournament-bracket-scores-stats-records|title=2015 NCAA tournament: Bracket, scores, stats, records &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com|accessdate=25 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-05-07/2016-ncaa-tournament-bracket-scores-stats-records|title=2016 NCAA tournament: Bracket, scores, stats, records &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com|accessdate=25 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-05-06/2017-ncaa-tournament-bracket-scores-stats-records|title=2017 NCAA tournament: Bracket, scores, stats, records &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com|accessdate=25 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-05-06/2018-ncaa-tournament-bracket-scores-stats-records|title=2018 NCAA tournament: Bracket, scores, stats, records &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com|accessdate=25 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-05-06/2019-ncaa-tournament-bracket-scores-stats-records|title=2019 NCAA tournament: Bracket, scores, stats, records &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com|accessdate=25 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/brackets/basketball-men/d1/2021|title=2021 Division I Men's Basketball Official Bracket &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com|accessdate=25 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/brackets/basketball-men/d1/2022|title=2022 Division I Men's Basketball Official Bracket &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com|accessdate=25 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/brackets/basketball-men/d1/2023|title=2023 Division I Men's Basketball Official Bracket &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com|accessdate=25 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/brackets/basketball-men/d1/2024|title=2024 Division I Men's Basketball Official Bracket &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com|accessdate=9 April 2024}}</ref>

Two teams made their first NCAA tournament appearances in school history: [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference|MEAC]] champion [[2011-12 Norfolk State Spartans men's basketball team|Norfolk State]] and [[Summit League]] champion [[2011–12 South Dakota State Jackrabbits men's basketball team|South Dakota State]]. [[Ivy League]] champion [[2011-12 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|Harvard]] made its first appearance since 1946, ending the [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament#Droughts|longest tournament drought in NCAA history]].

All four teams from the state of [[Ohio]] (Cincinnati, Ohio, Ohio State, and Xavier) made it to the Sweet 16, marking the first time in tournament history any state has been represented by four teams in the round of 16.<ref>[https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/tournament/2012/story/_/id/7719220/ncaa-tournament-2012-pride-ohio-four-teams-state-reach-sweet-16 Ohio is more than just Buckeye State] ESPN.com, March 21, 2012</ref> This tournament was also the first tournament since 1985 to feature no teams in the Sweet 16 from the Mountain or Pacific Time Zones.

==Tournament procedure==
{{further|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Current tournament format}}

A total of 68 teams entered the tournament. Thirty out of 31 automatic bids were given to the teams that won their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournament. The remaining automatic bid was awarded to the [[Ivy League]] regular season champion since they do not hold a conference tournament. The remaining 37 teams were granted "at-large" bids, which were extended by the NCAA Selection Committee on March 11.

Eight teams (the four-lowest seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the [[First Four]]. The winners of those games advanced to the main tournament [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]].

For the first time ever, the [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] publicly disclosed the overall rankings for each team, which are listed below.<ref>[https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2012-03-11/hardcore-breakdown-bracket 'Hardcore' breakdown of bracket] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412105657/http://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2012-03-11/hardcore-breakdown-bracket |date=2016-04-12 }} NCAA, March 11, 2012</ref>

On February 20, 2018, the NCAA announced that the wins and records for the 2011–12 season and Louisville's [[2012–13 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|2012–13]], [[2013–14 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|2013–14]], and [[2014–15 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|2014–15]] seasons were vacated due to the [[2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal|sex scandal at Louisville]].<ref>{{cite press release|last1=James|first1=Emily|title=Louisville men's basketball must vacate wins and pay fine|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/louisville-mens-basketball-must-vacate-wins-and-pay-fine|website=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 20, 2018|language=en|date=February 20, 2018}}</ref> Unlike forfeiture, a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win, only with Louisville removing the wins from its own record.
