The '''1989 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 16, 1989, and ended with the [[1989 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 3 in [[Seattle]]. A total of 63 games were played.

[[1988–89 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]], coached by [[Steve Fisher (American basketball coach)|Steve Fisher]], won the national title with an 80–79 overtime victory in the final game over [[1988–89 Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball team|Seton Hall]], coached by [[P. J. Carlesimo]]. [[Glen Rice]] of Michigan set an NCAA tournament record by scoring 184 points in six games and was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].

Just prior to the start of this tournament, Michigan coach [[Bill Frieder]] had announced that he would accept the head coaching position at [[Arizona State University]] at the end of the season. Michigan athletic director [[Bo Schembechler]] promptly fired Frieder and appointed top assistant Fisher as interim coach, stating famously, that "a Michigan man is going to coach a Michigan team."

Two 16-seeded teams came within one point of victory in the first round ([[1989 Georgetown vs. Princeton men's basketball game|Georgetown vs. Princeton]], Oklahoma vs. East Tennessee State), and a third came within six points. This tournament was also unusual in that all four 11-seeds advanced out of the first round.

The 1989 Tournament was the second one since 1980, with [[1987 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1987]] being the first, in which the defending national champion did not participate in the tournament. [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], winner of the [[1988 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1988 NCAA title]], had been placed on probation for violations committed by former coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] and was barred from the tournament. Brown left Kansas immediately after winning the national championship to return to coaching in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] with the [[San Antonio Spurs]], leaving first-year coach [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]]<!--Please do not add things like "To clean up the mess" to this page, such phrases are in violation of wikipedia policy--> to coach the team. It is the only time the Jayhawks have missed the NCAA tournament from 1984 to the present day. The defending champion would not be left out of the next year's tournament again until [[2008 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2008]]. The tournament was notable for the poor performance of the SEC.  After traditional stalwart Kentucky missed the postseason after experiencing its first losing season since 1927, none of the five SEC teams won a game in the tournament.

==Legacy==
The story of the Wolverines' success was cited as inspiration in another sport. When the [[Spain national football team]] manager [[Julen Lopetegui]] was sacked days before the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] started after agreeing to join [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] after the tournament, Spanish defender [[Gerard Piqué]] drew parallels with Michigan's NCAA win amid similar circumstances.<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=3gerardpique |author= Piqué, Gerard |author-link=Gerard Piqué |number=1006965710420103170 |date = June 13, 2018 |access-date=June 15, 2018 |title=Universidad de Michigan.
