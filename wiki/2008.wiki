The '''2008 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 65 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] that determined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[College basketball|basketball]] national champion for the [[2007-08 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2007-08 season]]. The 70th annual edition of the tournament began on March 18, 2008, and concluded with the [[2008 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|championship game]] on April 7, at the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]].

For the first time (and only time through the [[2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2024 tournament]]) since seeding began in [[1979 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1979]], all four of the top seeds advanced to the Final Four. These were [[2007–08 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team|Memphis]], the winner of the South region, [[2007–08 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]], the winner of the West region making their third consecutive Final Four appearance, [[2007–08 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], the winner of the Midwest region, and overall number one seed and East region winner [[2007–08 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]], back in the Final Four for the first time since their 2005 national championship.<ref name="NCAA Championship Information">{{cite web | url= http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/schedules | title=NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Information | access-date=2006-07-28| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060719233440/http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/schedules| archive-date= 19 July 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="2008 NCAA tournament selections">{{cite web | url= https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/ncaatourney08/news/story?id=3296729 | title=2008 NCAA tournament selections | date=March 16, 2008 | access-date=2016-02-17<!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

Memphis and Kansas advanced to the national championship game, with Memphis's victory in the semifinals giving them a record-setting 38 for the season, beating the mark set by [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] in 1999 ([[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] later matched this record in 2012 and 2015). Kansas, however, spoiled their national championship hopes by handing the Tigers their second loss of the season, winning the game in overtime, 75–68. Memphis's entire season was later vacated by the NCAA due to eligibility concerns surrounding freshman guard [[Derrick Rose]].<ref>[http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/story/13098232/ncaa-rejects-memphis-final-appeal-of-vacated-wins?tag=headlines;other NCAA rejects Memphis's final appeal of vacated wins]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202112400/http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/story/13098232/ncaa-rejects-memphis-final-appeal-of-vacated-wins?tag=headlines%3Bother |date=February 2, 2014 }}, cbssports.com, retrieved 2010-03-22</ref>

Entering the tournament on March 18, the top ranked team was [[2007–08 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] in both the [[AP Top 25]] and the [[Coaches' Poll|ESPN/USA Today Coaches']] Polls, followed by [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]], [[2007–08 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]] and [[2007–08 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]].

[[American University]] (Patriot), [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County|UMBC]] (America East), [[University of Texas at Arlington|Texas–Arlington]] (Southland), and [[Portland State]] (Big Sky) all entered the tournament for the first time in their school's history. Another school, [[2007–08 Coppin State Eagles men's basketball team|Coppin State]], won the MEAC Tournament to become the first 20-loss school to make the field. [[2007–08 Georgia Bulldogs basketball team|Georgia]], a team that otherwise would not have advanced to the tournament, [[Georgia Bulldogs basketball#2008 SEC Tournament: The Dream Dawgs|won the SEC tournament]] to qualify, and were awarded a #14 seed, the lowest by a major conference team in the tournament.

Whereas the 2007 tournament did not see many upsets, the 2008 tournament was full of them. The sub-regional pod played at the [[St. Pete Times Forum]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], featured four games where a double digit seed won. #5 seeds [[Drake Bulldogs men's basketball|Drake]] and [[Clemson Tigers men's basketball|Clemson]] fell to #12 seeds [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers men's basketball|Western Kentucky]] and [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]] while the #4 seeds in that same pod, [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt]] and [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]], were defeated by #13 seeds [[Siena Saints men's basketball|Siena]] and [[San Diego Toreros men's basketball|San Diego]]. Western Kentucky advanced to the West regional in Phoenix, where they lost to UCLA while Villanova was one of two double digit seeds to advance to the Midwest regional. The other was #10 seed [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson]], who rode the hot shooting of [[Stephen Curry]] to defeat [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]], [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], and [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin]] before nearly upsetting Kansas in the regional final. The Midwest region alone saw four of its double digit seeds advance, as in addition to Villanova, Siena, and Davidson, #11 seed [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]] knocked off #6 seed [[USC Trojans men's basketball|USC]].

The total tournament attendance of 763,607 set a record for highest total tournament attendance, breaking the record set during the [[1999 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1999 tournament]].

==Tournament procedure==
{{further|NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship#Tournament format}}

The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship is an annual single-elimination tournament featuring 65 teams representing all Division I Conferences in the nation. A "play-in" game determined which of the two lowest seeds would play in the first round of 64 against a top seed team. The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] seeded the entire field from 1 to 65 within four regionals of 16 teams; Mount St. Mary's, as the winner of the play-in game, automatically received a 16 seed.

===Listed by region and seeding===
A total of 31 teams received automatic bids for winning their conference tournament championship. Since the Ivy League does not hold a tournament, its regular season champion received the automatic bid. This left 34 at-large bids to be decided from the rest of the field by the NCAA Selection Committee. The at-large bids, along with the seeding for each team in the tournament, were announced on Sunday, March 16.<ref>[http://www.ticketsolutions.com/ncaa-selection.asp NCAA Tournament Selection Information from Ticket Solutions: Picking The Field] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517083543/http://www.ticketsolutions.com/ncaa-selection.asp |date=May 17, 2008 }}, ticketsolutions.com, retrieved 2008-03-22</ref> Coppin State was the first team to make the tournament with 20&nbsp;losses.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/broadband/video/videopage?videoId=3296941&categoryId=2459792 Breaking Down the East Region] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319103936/http://sports.espn.go.com/broadband/video/videopage?videoId=3296941&categoryId=2459792 |date=March 19, 2008 }}, [[ESPN]] Video, retrieved 2008-03-22</ref> Maryland-Baltimore County, American, Texas–Arlington, and Portland State all received their first tournament bids in school history.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280762466 ESPN – Texas-Arlington vs. Northwestern State – Recap – March 16, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319045141/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280762466 |date=March 19, 2008 }}, [[ESPN]], retrieved 2008-03-22</ref><ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280722502 ESPN – Northern Arizona vs. Portland State – Recap – March 12, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021522/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280722502 |date=April 11, 2016 }}, [[ESPN]], retrieved 2008-03-22</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/broadband/video/videopage?videoId=3297006&n8pe6c=1&categoryId=2459792 Breaking Down the Midwest Region] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325052118/http://sports.espn.go.com/broadband/video/videopage?videoId=3297006&n8pe6c=1&categoryId=2459792 |date=March 25, 2008 }}, [[ESPN]] Video, retrieved 2008-03-22</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280740044 ESPN – Colgate vs. American University – Recap – March 14, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115004228/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280740044 |date=January 15, 2016 }}, [[ESPN]], retrieved 2008-03-22</ref> Four teams returned after absences from the NCAA Tournament of 20 years or more—Drake (last appearing in [[1971 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1971]]),<ref name="MVC final">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280692181 |title=Drake pummels Illinois State, sweeps MVC titles |agency=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=2008-03-09 |access-date=2008-03-20| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080313014621/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280692181| archive-date= 13 March 2008 | url-status= dead}}</ref> Cal State Fullerton ([[1978 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1978]]),<ref name="Big West final">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280752239 |title=Big West win puts Cal State Fullerton in NCAA tourney for first time since '78 |agency=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=2008-03-15 |access-date=2008-03-20| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080320235535/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280752239| archive-date= 20 March 2008 | url-status= dead}}</ref> Cornell ([[1988 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1988]]),<ref name="Ivy clinched">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280610172 |title=Gore, Wittman will Cornell into Big Dance with first Ivy League title in 20 years |agency=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=2008-03-01 |access-date=2008-03-20| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080305135452/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280610172| archive-date= 5 March 2008 | url-status= dead}}</ref> and Baylor (1988).<ref name="Baylor v Purdue">{{cite news | url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/preview?gameId=284000039 | title=Baylor vs. Purdue: Preview | date=2008-03-20 | access-date=2008-06-09 | publisher=ESPNcom}}</ref>

USC vacated all 21 of its wins and its appearance in the 2008 NCAA tournament due to sanctions from the [[University of Southern California athletics scandal]]. Unlike forfeiture, a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win, only with USC removing the wins from its own record.

===East Region===

====First round====
Top seed North Carolina defeated the play-in game winner Mount St. Mary's 113–74. Their high scoring tied the mark for second most in North Carolina tournament history, aided by [[Tyler Hansbrough]] and [[Ty Lawson]]'s 21 points each.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000047 Mount St. Mary's vs. North Carolina – Recap – March 21, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021532/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000047 |date=April 11, 2016 }}, [[ESPN]], retrieved 2008-03-22</ref> They met Arkansas in the second round, a ninth seed who defeated eighth-seed Indiana 86–72.

====Second round====
Washington State, the region's fourth seed, was first to earn a spot in the [[Charlotte Bobcats Arena|Charlotte, North Carolina]] East Regional by handily beating fifth-seeded Notre Dame, 61–41 in [[Pepsi Center|Denver, Colorado]]. The rout came as a shock to many sportscasters, who expected Notre Dame's offense, which was averaging about 80 points a game, to outdo the Cougars. Instead, Notre Dame shot 24% from the field, their worst offensive effort since 1983 and the fifth-worst in the history of the NCAA tournament's opening rounds. Washington State's win brought them to their first-ever trip to the Sweet 16. Top-seeded North Carolina will challenge the Cougars after defeating Arkansas, the ninth seed, 108–77. The win marked only the third time the Tar Heels had won their first two tournament games by more than 20 points. The other two UNC teams to do this, in 1993 and 2005, went on to win the championship. With the win, North Carolina also set a school record for wins in a season, with 34.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000049 ESPN – Arkansas vs. North Carolina – Recap – March 23, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021537/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000049 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref> Second-seeded Tennessee survived an upset bid from number seven seed Butler, winning in overtime 76–71. Butler was behind throughout regulation, but managed to keep the game close and bring it to overtime, where they gained their first lead, 68–66, about 2 minutes into overtime. Some key defensive stands and free throws by the Volunteers, however, pulled them ahead.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000059 ESPN – Butler vs. Tennessee – Recap – March 23, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021538/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000059 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref> They will play third seed Louisville, who beat sixth seed Oklahoma, 78–48. Sooner star [[Blake Griffin]] had trouble scoring against Louisville's double-teams, and Louisville's 30-point win was the school's best tournament win since 1968.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000056 ESPN – Oklahoma vs. Louisville – Recap – March 23, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021538/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000056 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref>

====Regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen)====
Top-seeded North Carolina defeated fourth seeded Washington State 68–47. Washington State was held to 47 points, the least allowed by a Tar Heel team in the tournament since 1946. Tyler Hansbrough struggled in the first half, but North Carolina's other players stepped to give the team a 14-point lead at halftime. In the second half, he led the team with 16 points, contributing to what was at one point in the half a 26-point lead.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000053 ESPN – Washington State vs. North Carolina – Recap – March 27, 2008<!-- reflinks title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021538/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000053 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref> Third-seeded Louisville went on to face the Tar Heels in the East finals after defeating the second-seeded Tennessee Volunteers, 79–60. [[Earl Clark]] scored 17 points, 13 of them coming in the second half, and had 12 rebounds to lead the Cardinals. The Volunteers were held to 34% shooting and Louisville coach Rick Pitino improved to 8–0 in Regional semifinal games.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000060 ESPN – Louisville vs. Tennessee – Recap – March 27, 2008<!-- reflinks title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021538/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000060 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref>

The Cardinals came close as the game neared its end, but a Ty Lawson 3 broke a 59–59 tie. Defensive stands combined with 8 for 8 free throw shooting down the stretch gave the Tar Heels the victory.

===Midwest Region===

====First round====
[[File:St Pete Times Forum At Sunset.jpg|thumb|The [[Amalie Arena]] saw a record four upsets in four games in the tournament's first round.]]
The Midwest Region featured upsets knocking off the fourth through seventh seeds. Among these was the first upset of the tournament with 11th seed Kansas State's win over the sixth seeded Southern California Trojans 80–67 in [[Qwest Center Omaha|Omaha, Nebraska]]. The media had focused a lot of attention on the freshman stars of both teams, the Wildcats' [[Michael Beasley]] and the Trojans' [[O. J. Mayo]]. In reality, while Beasley and Mayo did well, it was the other K-State players who made the difference, applying a strong defense to the Men of Troy's attack and coming up with the school's first tournament win since 1988.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000008 ESPN – Kansas State vs. USC – Recap – March 20, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021539/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000008 |date=April 11, 2016 }}, [[ESPN]], retrieved 2008-03-22</ref> Also in the Midwest Region, #10 seed Davidson defeated seventh seeded Gonzaga 82–76 in [[PNC Arena|Raleigh, North Carolina]]. [[Stephen Curry]] led the Wildcats with 40 points, 30 of them in the second half.

The Wildcats have won more games as an underdog in the tournament since seedings began in 1979 than any other team. With Villanova's win, the Forum saw a tournament record four upsets in one day.

Kansas completed the first all top-seeded Final Four in NCAA Tournament history as they defeated tenth seeded Davidson 59–57. The outcome remained in doubt down to the final seconds. Kansas' Sherron Collins missed a shot with 21 seconds left, giving Davidson the final shot. Sophomore star Stephen Curry was double teamed, couldn't find a shot, and passed to Jason Richards, whose three-point shot missed. It was head coach [[Bill Self]]'s first regional final win. The Wildcats' 25-game winning streak, the longest in the nation, was broken with the loss. Davidson's Stephen Curry scored 25 points and was chosen as the Midwest Region's Most Outstanding Player.<ref name="scores.espn.go.com">[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000015 ESPN – Davidson vs. Kansas – Recap – March 30, 2008<!-- reflinks title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021550/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000015 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref>

====Regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen)====
Tens of thousands of Texas fans turned out to Reliant Stadium in Houston and saw the second seeded Longhorns defeat the number three seeded Stanford Cardinal, 82–62. The unlikely defensive star of the game was Texas' [[Dexter Pittman]]. Normally not even a starter, Pittman was effective on the court, throwing his size against the tall Lopez twins, high-scorers at Stanford. On the offensive end, [[D. J. Augustin]] scored twenty-three points to combine with [[Damion James]]' 18 for the win. Stanford made things close at about the 13 minute mark of the second half, bringing it to within one at 52–51, but Texas went on a 16–2 run and turned the game into a rout.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000029 ESPN – Stanford vs. Texas – Recap – March 28, 2008<!-- reflinks title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021558/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000029 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref> Later in the day, top-seeded Memphis defeated fifth seed Michigan State, 92–74. Memphis entered the game as the favorite but with several commentators pointing to them as the top seed most likely to lose. Instead, the Tigers went into halftime with a 30-point lead. Derrick Rose led his team with 27 points, and [[Chris Douglas-Roberts]] followed with 25, while Spartan star [[Drew Neitzel]] was held to just six.<ref>[https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/boxscore?gameId=284000022 ESPN – Michigan State vs. Memphis – Box Score – March 28, 2008<!-- reflinks title -->] </ref>

====Regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen)====
Xavier, the third seed in the West, defeated seventh seed West Virginia, 79–75 in overtime thanks to two [[B.J. Raymond]] three-pointers in the final 78 seconds. Raymond scored all eight of his points in the bonus round after being held scoreless in regulation, and poor free-throw shooting by the Mountaineers, missing four out of six free throws, sealed the victory. Josh Duncan led the Musketeers in scoring with a career-high 26 points, followed by Joe Alexander's 18 points and 10 rebounds. Xavier led by as much as 18 during the game, but trailed six late in OT, counting on Raymond's threes to give them the victory.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000045 ESPN – Raymond saves Xavier with two 3-pointers in last 1:18 of overtime] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235623/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000045 |date=April 26, 2014 }}</ref>  Number one seed UCLA would play the Musketeers in the final, after outlasting 12th seeded WKU, 88–78.

The second semifinal was a highly anticipated matchup between North Carolina Head Coach [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] and the team he had coached for 15 years before leaving to go to UNC. The game itself could be divided up as if it were three different games. The Jayhawks took a 40–12 lead in the first 15 minutes, causing CBS analyst Billy Packer to declare that the game was over. North Carolina narrowed the deficit to 17 at halftime on a 15–4 run and opened the second half on a 23–10 run to close to within 4 points with 11 minutes to play. After the teams traded baskets for a few minutes, Kansas pulled away, closing on a 20–7 run for an 84–66 victory. After Kansas went out to the 40–12 lead, North Carolina never held the ball with a chance to take the lead.  Brandon Rush led the Jayhawks with 25 points. AP Player of the Year Tyler Hansbrough scored 17 points and had 9 rebounds, both below his season averages. The Tar Heels were led by Wayne Ellington's 18 points.<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000031 ESPN – Kansas vs. North Carolina – Recap – April 05, 2008<!-- reflinks title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411021959/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000031 |date=April 11, 2016 }}</ref>

The National Championship Game pitted [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]] against [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]]. The head coaches (KU's [[Bill Self]] and Memphis' [[John Calipari]]) had both been on the coaching staff of Kansas' 1986 Final Four team.

Memphis guard [[Chris Douglas-Roberts]] had been the leading scorer in the tournament, averaging 23.6 points per game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/marchmadness/story/566220.html |title=Championship game has spotlight matchup |newspaper=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |access-date=2008-04-06 |date=2008-04-06 |author=Barnhouse, Wendell |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724003954/http://www.star-telegram.com/marchmadness/story/566220.html |archive-date=July 24, 2008 }}</ref> Memphis became the first team currently from a [[College basketball#Conferences|conference]] other than the six majors to play in the championship game since 1998.

On the day of the game, the betting lines set by [[Las Vegas]] [[casino]]s [[Las Vegas Hilton]], [[Station Casinos]], and [[The Mirage]] made Memphis the favorite by a [[Spread betting|spread]] of 2 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegas.com/gaming/|title=Lines for:NCAA Basketball Current as of 04/07/2008 12:43:02|publisher=Vegas.com|access-date=2008-04-07|date=2008-04-07| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080409050029/http://www.vegas.com/gaming/| archive-date= 9 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

The first half was back-and-forth as Kansas led for 7:37 minutes and Memphis led for 6:51 minutes. Kansas led 33–28 at halftime, the first second-half deficit that Memphis faced in the entire tournament. Memphis scored the first five points of the second half to tie the score at 33 with 18:57 left in regulation. After that Kansas maintained a small lead from the 16:04 mark until Memphis retook the lead with 8:11 remaining. Memphis then went on a 10–0 run to build a seven-point lead with 5:10 remaining and increased it to nine points with 2:12 remaining in regulation.<ref name=playbyplay>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/playbyplay?gameId=284000063|title=Kansas vs. Memphis: Play by Play|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2008-04-08|date=2008-04-07| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080412093412/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/playbyplay?gameId=284000063| archive-date= 12 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Kansas strategically fouled Memphis—an extremely poor free throw shooting team all season—which missed four of its final five free throws in regulation while Kansas furiously scored 12 points in the final two minutes of regulation. During that stretch Kansas made 100% of their shots going 2 for 2 from two-point range, 2 for 2 from three-point range and 2 for 2 from the free throw line.  When Memphis failed to foul, which arguably would have all but assured a victory for the Tigers, Kansas guard [[Mario Chalmers]] hit a three-point basket with 2.1 seconds remaining to tie the game at 63, sending the game into overtime. Kansas fans now refer to this shot as Mario's Miracle.<ref name=playbyplay/> At the end of regulation, the Jayhawks had led the score a total of 17:55 minutes and Memphis 15:51 minutes.

In overtime, Kansas scored the first six points en route to a 75–68 win. They continued the blistering stretch they started in regulation, going 4 of 6 from the field and 4 of 4 from the line in overtime.  It was KU's third NCAA title since the modern tournament began in 1939 (fifth national title overall, including two [[Helms Foundation|Helms decisions]]). It was also the first national championship for the program since the [[1987–88 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|1988 team]].

This was the seventh overtime National Championship Game in NCAA Division I tournament history and first since 1997. It also represented the first national title for the [[Big 12 Conference]].

The national championship appearance by Memphis would later be vacated as a result of NCAA rules infractions.

===Television===

====CBS Sports====
[[File:JimNantz2001.jpg|thumb|[[Jim Nantz]], CBS Sports television announcer for the 2008 Final Four along with [[Billy Packer]]]]
For the 27th consecutive year, [[CBS Sports]] telecast the tournament, and for the 18th consecutive year, broadcast every game in the main bracket from the first round to the championship, as [[Jim Nantz]] and [[Billy Packer]] called the Final Four. [[ESPN]] carried the 64th-seed opening-round game between Coppin State and Mount St. Mary's on March 18, with [[Brent Musburger]], [[Steve Lavin]] and [[Erin Andrews]] serving as the announcing team, as the network has done the opening-round game since 2002.

The complete list of announcing teams follows:

*[[Jim Nantz]], [[Billy Packer]] and [[Sam Ryan]] (she was only used as Sideline Reporter for the Final Four and NCAA Championship game) – first & second round at Raleigh, North Carolina; South Regional at Houston, Texas; Final Four at San Antonio, Texas (It should be also noted that this was the 1st time Jim Nantz introduced the lineups in the Final Four semi-finals and the National Championship Game).
*[[Dick Enberg]]/[[Carter Blackburn]] and [[Jay Bilas]] – Blackburn Thursday afternoon; Enberg Thursday night, First & Second round at Anaheim, California; East Regional at Charlotte, North Carolina
*[[Verne Lundquist]] and [[Bill Raftery]] – first & second round at Birmingham, Alabama; West Regional at Phoenix, Arizona
*[[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]] and [[Len Elmore]] – first & second round at Denver, Colorado; Midwest Regional at Detroit, Michigan
*[[Kevin Harlan]] and [[Dan Bonner]] – first & second round at Omaha, Nebraska
*[[Ian Eagle]] and [[Jim Spanarkel]] – first & second round at Little Rock, Arkansas
*[[Craig Bolerjack]] and [[Bob Wenzel]] – first & second round at Washington, D.C.
*[[Tim Brando]] and [[Mike Gminski]] – first & second round at Tampa, Florida

[[Greg Gumbel]] once again served as the studio host, joined by analysts [[Clark Kellogg]] and [[Seth Davis]].  For the first time since the rights were acquired, the host team spent the entire tournament at the [[CBS Broadcast Center]] in New York City and did not travel to the Final Four site. CBS cited budget cutbacks ordered by the parent company, [[CBS Corporation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} This would be Billy Packer's 35th and final tournament as a broadcaster, ending a streak that began in 1975; in July 2008, it was announced that Kellogg would replace Packer as Nantz's color man in [[2009 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2009]].

Several affiliates showed additional games on digital subchannels, and once, the Los Angeles area had simultaneous telecasts on two stations: On March 20, UCLA vs. Mississippi Valley State was shown on [[KCBS-TV|KCBS]] and Cal State Fullerton vs. Wisconsin was on [[independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[KDOC-TV|KDOC]] at the same time.  (KCBS has a duopoly with [[KCAL-TV|KCAL]], but KCAL was unavailable because of a third basketball game, one between the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Utah Jazz]] in [[Salt Lake City]].)

====CBS College Sports Network====
Sibling cable network CBS College Sports Network (now known as [[CBS Sports Network]]) picked up one CBS TV broadcast on each of the first two days of the tournament. It aired the Stanford-Cornell contest from Anaheim on March 20, and the St. Joseph's-Oklahoma game on March 21.

Unlike CBS Sports on the broadcast side, CBS College Sports Network did send a team to San Antonio, with Blackburn anchoring coverage and hosting the postgame highlights show, called the ''NCAA March Madness Highlights Show''. Earlier, [[Greg Amsinger]] had hosted the postgame program from the network's studios at [[Chelsea Piers]] in [[lower Manhattan]].

===Other media===
[[DirecTV]] once again offered [[NCAA Mega March Madness]] as a [[pay-per-view]] package for one payment of US$69. This allowed access to all tournament games in the first three rounds of the main draw not shown on the local CBS station in the viewer's area. This package was exclusive to DirecTV and not available to [[Dish Network]], [[FiOS|fiber optic]], or [[cable television|cable]] subscribers.

Online, [[CBSSports.com]] and NCAA.com teamed up for NCAA March Madness on Demand. Computer users with broadband connections were able to watch all tournament games from the first round to the championship game for free, thanks to advertiser support from [[Coca-Cola]], [[AT&T Mobility]], [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]], and various other companies. The ads were not the same as those shown on television, and there was a separate halftime show hosted by Jason Horowitz joined by analysts including [[St. John's Red Storm|St. John's]] head basketball coach [[Norm Roberts]].
