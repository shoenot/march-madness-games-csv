The '''2011 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 68 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] that determined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[College basketball|basketball]] national champion for the [[2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2010-11 season]]. The 73rd edition of the NCAA tournament began on March 15, 2011, and concluded with the [[2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|championship game]] on April 4, at [[Reliant Stadium]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. This tournament marked the introduction of the "[[#First Four – Dayton, Ohio|First Four]]" round and an expansion of the field of participants from 65 teams to 68. Due to the geographical location of New Orleans and San Antonio, the "South" and "Midwest" regional games were replaced for this tournament by the monikers "Southeast" and "Southwest", respectively.

The Final Four featured no top seeds for the first time since [[2006 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2006]], with the highest remaining seed being West Region winner, #3 [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]]. For the first time since [[2000 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2000]], a #8 seed advanced to the Final Four as [[Butler Bulldogs men's basketball|Butler]], the national runner-up from the year before, won the Southeast Region. For only the third time ever, a #11 seed advanced to the Final Four as [[VCU Rams men's basketball|Virginia Commonwealth]], one of the "First Four" teams, won the Southwest Region. Those three teams were joined by East Region champion [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]], a #4 seed. This was also the first Final Four to not feature any 1-seed or 2-seeds. The Final Four had the highest combined Final Four seeds since seeding started in [[1979 NCAA Division I basketball tournament|1979]], with 26 (11-VCU, 8-Butler, 4-Kentucky & 3-Connecticut). Connecticut defeated Butler in the championship game 53–41, winning its third national championship in as many attempts.

Upsets ruled the 2011 tournament. The East Region saw its #11 seed, [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]], advance to the Sweet Sixteen where they were downed by [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]]. The Southwest Region saw four of its double digit seeds win, as VCU was joined by #12 seed and citymate [[Richmond Spiders men's basketball|Richmond]], #10 seed [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]], and #13 seed [[Morehead State Eagles men's basketball|Morehead State]] as first round winners. Florida State, VCU, and Richmond all advanced to the Sweet Sixteen from that region, and VCU defeated top-seeded [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] in the final. Butler and #11 seed [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]] advanced from the Southeast Region, with Gonzaga losing in the Round of 32 to [[BYU Cougars men's basketball|BYU]].

For the third time in as many appearances, [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt]] suffered a defeat to a double digit seed. This time, they were defeated by Richmond as a #5 seed.

The Big East had a then–record 11 teams make the tournament until it was surpassed by the [[Southeastern Conference]] in [[2025 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2025]], with 14 teams. Due to having more than eight teams qualify, it was possible for intra-Big East matchups to occur in the third round. Two of these matchups did occur as Marquette defeated [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]] in the East while Connecticut defeated [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] in the West. The other Big East teams to qualify were [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pittsburgh]], who earned the #1 seed in the Southeast Region and were knocked out in the third round by Butler, [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]], who were the Southeast's #6 seed and were eliminated in their first game by Gonzaga, [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]], which earned the #4 seed in the Southwest and fell to Morehead State in their first game, [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], who lost to VCU in the first round as a #6 in the Southwest, [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]], the #2 seed in the Southwest who were eliminated by Florida State, [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]], who were eliminated in an #8 vs #9 matchup against [[George Mason Patriots men's basketball|George Mason]] in the East Region, and [[West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball|West Virginia]], the East's #5 seed who lost in the third round to Kentucky.

This was the last NCAA tournament until [[2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2023]] in which a mid-major conference saw multiple teams reach the Sweet 16, as both BYU and San Diego State did from the Mountain West Conference.

[[2010–11 Northern Colorado Bears men's basketball team|Northern Colorado]], winners of the [[Big Sky Conference]], made its first NCAA Division I tournament.

{{Further|NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship#Tournament}}

For the first time, a total of 68 teams entered the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wieberg|first=Steve|title=NCAA tournament has new look, more games, more channels|work=USA Today|date=March 11, 2011|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/2011-03-10-new-ncaa-tournament_N.htm|access-date=April 15, 2011}}</ref> Thirty of the thirty-one automatic bids were given to the programs that won their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournaments, while the remaining automatic bid went to the [[Ivy League]] champion [[2010–11 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team|Princeton]], as the conference does not hold a tournament. The remaining 37 teams were granted "at-large" bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.  All 68 teams were announced on "Selection Sunday" March 13, 2011.

The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] ranked the entire field from 1 to 68.  The last four at-large teams selected and the four lowest ranked automatic qualifiers played in a "First Four".<ref name=Katz>{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=5374116 |title=Last four at-large to play in first round |first=Andy |last=Katz |author-link=Andy Katz |publisher=ESPN |date=July 12, 2010 |access-date=July 13, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100713232021/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=5374116| archive-date= July 13, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>  The four winners of those games advanced to the main draw of the tournament to play a higher seed. The four lowest ranked teams of the 68 played against each other in a pair of First Four games, with winners advancing to play No. 1 seeds, and the last four at-large teams played in the other two First Four games, with the winners moving on to face the seed they would otherwise be matched up against, as determined by their seed number.

The National Championship game was between Butler, a [[mid-major]] university team that was a surprise finalist in the [[2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2010 tournament]], and Connecticut, a basketball powerhouse which had previously won the tournament twice under coach [[Jim Calhoun]] but had an average regular season finishing 9th in the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] before winning The Big East tournament with five wins in five consecutive days (never before accomplished in NCAA history).  The championship game was won by Connecticut 53–41. It was a very defensive contest, with Butler having the fewest points in a championship game since 1949.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/sports/ncaabasketball/05ncaa.html?_r=1&hp | work=The New York Times | first=Pete | last=Thamel |author-link=Pete Thamel | title=UConn Cuts Down Nets After Butler Rattles the Rims | date=April 5, 2011}}</ref>  Butler led at halftime 22–19, but suffered in the second half from poor shooting, making only 6 of 37 shots in the second half.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  Butler's 18.8 percent shooting for the entire game was the lowest ever in the NCAA final.

==Media==

===Television===
On April 22, 2010, it was announced that the NCAA had reached a new 14-year, US$10.8 billion deal with [[CBS Sports]] and [[Time Warner]]-owned [[Turner Sports]] (by way of [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[truTV]]) for the rights to broadcast the NCAA tournament from 2011 until 2024 (later extended to 2032 in the [[2016 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2016 tournament]]), marking the first time every game in the tournament would be telecast on a national basis.

CBS and Turner pooled their resources for the tournament, with members of the ''[[NBA on TNT]]'' crew joining CBS's established March Madness broadcasters. Coverage will originate from the [[CBS Broadcast Center]] in New York City and Turner's [[Atlanta]] studios.<ref name="CBS/Turner talent">{{cite web|author=[[Turner Sports]]|publisher=NCAA.com|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/2011-01-18/cbs-turner-combine-talent-rosters|title=CBS, Turner combine talent rosters|access-date=January 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426055252/http://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/2011-01-18/cbs-turner-combine-talent-rosters|archive-date=April 26, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The tournament television ratings report shows the tournament had an average of 10.2 million viewers per game, an increase from the 2005 tournament when it drew an average of 10.6 million (6.4 [[ACNielsen|Nielsen]] rating). The championship game recorded an 11.7 rating and drew 20.1 million viewers.

[[TruTV]], which up to that point had never aired any live sports programming, saw a surge in carriage deals for its high definition feed with several major providers including [[AT&T U-verse]], [[Verizon FiOS]], [[Comcast]], [[Charter Communications]], [[Cablevision]], [[Cox Cable]] and [[RCN Corporation|RCN]].<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/465297-TruTV_Nets_HD_Channel_Launches.php TruTV Nets HD Channel Launches] ''Multichannel News'' March 15, 2011</ref>

CBS received the same number of "windows", or time slots, for its tournament coverage as in previous years. However, all games will now be nationally{{Snd}} rather than regionally{{Snd}} televised. The national television broadcasts also allowed for more flexibility in start times. CBS and the Turner networks used the same graphics package and theme music in broadcasting the tournament{{Snd}} the only difference between networks is the logo shown on the [[score bug]]. In addition, a banner at the top of the screen displayed the scores of other games along with what network they are being broadcast on. Replays feature all four network logos being shown, and for [[fair use]] highlight credits by local television stations and other networks such as [[ESPN]], the Turner network name or CBS Sports, followed by  "NCAA" is given as the source. CBS also kept coverage of the [[NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Championship|Division II final]], which is part of the larger contract for this tournament.

Turner Sports aired full-length studio shows before and after each session of play. The pregame show was called ''[[Infiniti]] NCAA Tip-Off'' and all shows were on TruTV.  The postgame show, called ''Inside March Madness presented by [[Buick]]'', alternated between TruTV and TBS.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/48576510/2011-NCAA-Tournament-TV-Schedule/ 2011 NCAA Tournament TV Schedule]</ref>

TruTV had also added coverage of the [[Reese's College All-Star Game]].

===Radio===
[[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] had live broadcasts of all 67 games.  They will be available both on terrestrial and satellite radio outlets, on NCAA.com, and on [[CBSSports.com]].  The radio contract was extended in January 2011 for multiple tournaments.<ref name="Westwood One">{{cite press release|author=[[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]]|publisher=PR Newswire|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/westwood-one-and-the-ncaa-announce-new-multi-year-radio-rights-agreement-113458339.html|title=Westwood One and the NCAA Announce New Multi-Year Radio Rights Agreement|access-date=January 26, 2011}}</ref>

===Internet/other video===
All games are expected to be streamed at NCAA.com or CBSSports.com, as in the past; with the new rights deal, NCAA.com and the game streaming is now managed by Turner Interactive.  The [[iPhone]] app which allowed streaming of games on the iPhone in previous years, and had cost about ten dollars, has received two upgrades: it is compatible with [[iPad]], and it is now free of charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/mobile-march-madness-best-iphone-apps-ipad-ncaa-tournament/2/|title=Mobile March Madness:Best iPhone Apps|first=Digital Trends|last=Staff|work=[[Digital Trends]]|date=March 14, 2011|access-date=March 29, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110430202046/http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/mobile-march-madness-best-iphone-apps-ipad-ncaa-tournament/2/| archive-date= April 30, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref> However, with the CBS-Turner agreement allowing all games in the tournament to be available on a national basis (see [[#Television|above]]), Mega March Madness, a [[DirecTV]]-only service, has been discontinued.

===International===
* {{flagu|Canada}}: [[The Sports Network|TSN]] acquired Canadian rights for the tournament, rights which were previously held by [[The Score Television Network|The Score]]. This is apparently the result of a larger international rights deal between the NCAA and [[ESPN International]] (which owns a minority interest in TSN).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/bruce-dowbiggin/tsn-catches-march-madness/article1919949/|title=TSN catches March Madness|first=Bruce|last=Dowbiggin|work=Globe and Mail |date=February 24, 2011|access-date=March 14, 2011|location=Toronto| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110303090954/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/bruce-dowbiggin/tsn-catches-march-madness/article1919949/| archive-date=March 3, 2011<!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>  TSN had its own studio programming hosted by [[Dan Shulman]] and [[James Cybulski]], and game coverage came from CBS and Turner.  Unlike the Score, which had whiparound coverage, TSN and TSN2 showed entire games.  Sometimes, both channels aired games, but on Friday of the first weekend, no games were shown due to previous programming commitments on both channels.  TSN.ca also streamed first-round games to those with Canadian [[IP address]]es.
*{{flag|Philippines}}: [[Basketball TV]] planned to broadcast the NCAA tournament using the American feed.
*Worldwide: The NCAA.com video and audio streams were available with no [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] restrictions anywhere in the world.
