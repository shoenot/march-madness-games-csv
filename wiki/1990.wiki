The '''1990 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in a [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] tournament to determine the [[NCAA Division I]] men's basketball national champion for the [[1989–90 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|1989-1990 season]]. It began on March 15, 1990, and ended with the [[1990 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 2 in [[Denver, Colorado]]. A total of 63 games were played.

[[1989–90 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV]] won the national title with a 103–73 victory in the final game over [[1989–90 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]]. In doing so, UNLV set the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament record for largest margin of victory in a championship game. UNLV's championship win marks the last time a school from a non-[[power conference]] has won the tournament. [[Anderson Hunt]] of UNLV was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].

This tournament is also remembered for an emotional run by the [[1989–90 Loyola Marymount Lions men's basketball team|Loyola Marymount Lions]] (LMU) in the West region. In the quarterfinals of the [[West Coast Conference]] tournament against the [[Portland Pilots men's basketball|Portland Pilots]], Lions star forward [[Hank Gathers]] collapsed and died due to a heart condition.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Nehus Saxon |first=Lisa |date=March 6, 1990 |title=Winning and losing: Players, friends believed Gathers was invincible |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryJKAAAAIBAJ&lpg=PA9&dq=hank%20gathers%20AND%20heart%20-AP&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q=hank%20gathers%20AND%20heart%20-AP&f=false |access-date=January 16, 2025 |work=The Vindicator |pages=11}}</ref> The WCC tournament was immediately suspended and LMU, the regular-season champion, was given the conference's automatic bid to the tournament. The team defeated [[1989–90 New Mexico State Aggies men's basketball team|New Mexico State]], then laid a 34-point thrashing on defending national champion [[1989–90 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]], and defeated [[1989–90 Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team|Alabama]] in the Sweet Sixteen (the only game in which LMU did not score 100 or more points in the tournament) before running into eventual champion UNLV in the regional final. Gathers' childhood friend, [[Bo Kimble]], the team's undisputed floor leader in the wake of the tragedy, paid tribute to his friend by attempting his first free throw in each game left-handed despite being right-handed (Gathers was right-handed, but struggled so much with free throws that he tried shooting them left-handed for a time.)<ref>{{Cite news |first= |date=March 19, 1990 |title=This Bo knows heartache, happiness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mm4iAAAAIBAJ&lpg=PA25&dq=bo%20kimble%20AND%20free%20throw%20shooting&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q=bo%20kimble%20AND%20free%20throw%20shooting&f=false |access-date=January 16, 2025 |work=The Argus-Press}}</ref> Kimble made all of his left-handed attempts in the tournament.

The tournament employed a new timing system borrowed from [[FIBA]] & the [[NBA]]: when the game was played in an NBA arena, the final minute of the period is measured in tenths-seconds, rather than whole seconds as in previous years.
