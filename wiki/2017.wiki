The '''2017 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament''' involved 68 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] to determine the men's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[college basketball]] national champion for the [[2016–17 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2016–17 season]]. The 79th edition of the tournament began on March 14, 2017, and concluded with the [[2017 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|championship game]] on April 3 at [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]]. The championship game was the first to be contested in the [[Western United States]] since the [[1995 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1995 tournament]] when [[Seattle]] was the host of the Final Four.

In the Final Four, [[2016–17 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] beat [[2016–17 Oregon Ducks men's basketball team|Oregon]] (making their first Final Four appearance since the inaugural tournament in [[1939 NCAA basketball tournament|1939]])<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2017/04/01/north-carolina-oregon-final-four-results-recap|title=UNC holds off Oregon, to face Gonzaga in final|last=Woo|first=Jeremy|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref> while [[2016–17 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gonzaga]] defeated [[2016–17 South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball team|South Carolina]] (both making their first ever Final Four appearance).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/final-four-2017-gonzaga-holds-on-to-beat-south-carolina-advances-to-title-game/|title=Final Four 2017: Gonzaga holds on to beat South Carolina, advances to title game|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en}}</ref> This was the first NCAA tournament since [[1979 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1979]] to see two first-time Final Four participants.

After being the only longstanding [[Power Five conferences|Power Five]] team to never made the tournament, [[2016–17 Northwestern Wildcats men's basketball team|Northwestern]] from the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] finally made the tournament for the first time in program history.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/12/sport/ncaa-selection-sunday-northwestern-first-ncaa-bid/index.html|title=At long last, Northwestern reaches NCAAs|first=Jill |last=Martin|work=CNN|date=March 12, 2017|access-date=April 2, 2024}}</ref> [[2016–17 North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's basketball team|North Dakota]] ([[Big Sky Conference|Big Sky]]), [[2016–17 UC Davis Aggies men's basketball team|UC Davis]] ([[Big West Conference|Big West]]), [[2016–17 Northern Kentucky Norse men's basketball team|Northern Kentucky]] ([[Horizon League]]), and [[2016–17 Jacksonville State Gamecocks men's basketball team|Jacksonville State]] ([[Ohio Valley Conference|Ohio Valley]]) also all made their tournament debuts.

==Tournament procedures==
{{further|NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament#Current tournament format}}

A total of 68 teams entered the 2017 tournament, with all 32 [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournament winners receiving an automatic bid. The [[Ivy League]], which previously granted its automatic tournament bid to its regular season champion, hosted a postseason tournament to determine a conference champion for the first time. In previous years, had the Ivy League had two schools tied for first in the standings, a one-game playoff (or series as was the case in the 2002 season) determined the automatic bid. On March 10, 2016, the Ivy League's council of presidents approved a four-team tournament where the top four teams in the regular season would play on March 11 and 12 at Philadelphia's [[Palestra]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=The Ivy League Adds Men's, Women's Basketball Tournaments Beginning in 2017|url=http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017|publisher=[[Ivy League]]|date=March 10, 2016|access-date=March 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311041901/http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017|archive-date=March 11, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The remaining 36 teams received "at-large" bids which are extended by the NCAA [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]]. On January 24, 2016, the NCAA announced that the Selection Committee would, for the first time, unveil in-season rankings of the top four teams in each division on February 11, 2017.<ref name="usatoday-earlypreview">{{cite news|last=Auerbach|first=Nicole|title=Midseason March Madness sneak preview should bring positive buzz|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/columnist/nicole-auerbach/2017/01/24/ncaa-tournament-sneak-preview-march-madness-top-16-seeds/96992158/|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=January 24, 2017|access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref>

Eight teams—the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams—played in the First Four (the successor to what had been known as "[[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Opening Round game|play-in games]]" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the main draw of the tournament.

The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.<ref>{{cite news|title=March Madness bracket: How the 68 teams are selected for the Division I men's basketball tournament|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2016-02-18/march-madness-bracket-how-68-teams-are-selected-division-i|publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association|date=February 18, 2016|access-date=March 3, 2017}}</ref>

The committee's selections resulted in two historic milestones. The [[Northwestern Wildcats men's basketball|Northwestern Wildcats]] of the [[Big Ten Conference]] made their first-ever NCAA Tournament in school history, officially becoming the last "power conference" school to make the tournament. (This fact is ironic considering that Northwestern hosted the [[1939 NCAA basketball tournament|first-ever NCAA Tournament in 1939]]). The Wildcats' First round opponent, the [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt Commodores]] of the [[Southeastern Conference]], also made history: with a record of 19–15, they set the mark for the most ever losses for an at-large team in tournament history.

Four conference champions also made their first NCAA appearances: [[2016–17 North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's basketball team|North Dakota]] ([[Big Sky Conference]]), [[2016–17 UC Davis Aggies men's basketball team|UC Davis]] ([[Big West Conference]]), [[2016–17 Jacksonville State Gamecocks men's basketball team|Jacksonville State]] ([[Ohio Valley Conference]]), and first-year Division I school [[2016–17 Northern Kentucky Norse men's basketball team|Northern Kentucky]] ([[Horizon League]]).
