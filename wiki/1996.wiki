The '''1996 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 14, 1996, and ended with the [[1996 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 1 at [[Continental Airlines Arena]] (now known as Meadowlands Arena) in the [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. A total of 63 games were played.<ref>{{Cite web |title=1996 NCAA tournament: Bracket, scores, stats, records {{!}} NCAA.com |url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-05-11/1996-ncaa-tournament-bracket-scores-stats-records?amp |access-date=2024-12-09 |website=www.ncaa.com |language=en}}</ref>

The Final Four venue was notable for several reasons:
*This marked the first time that the NCAA finals had been held in [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York]] since [[1950 NCAA Basketball Tournament|1950]].
*This was also the last (men's) Final Four to be held in a basketball/hockey-specific facility. Every Final Four since has been held in a domed stadium (usually built for football) because of NCAA venue capacity requirements. Therefore, this was also the ''last'' time the NCAA finals have been held in the Greater New York area and the [[Northeastern United States]] (for the time being).
The Final Four consisted of [[1995–96 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], making its first appearance in the Final Four since 1993 and eleventh overall, [[1995–96 UMass Minutemen basketball team|Massachusetts]], making its first ever appearance in the Final Four, [[1995–96 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team|Syracuse]], making its third appearance in the Final Four and first since 1987, and [[Mississippi State Bulldogs men's basketball|Mississippi State]], also making its first appearance.

Kentucky, coached by [[Rick Pitino]], won its sixth national championship by defeating Syracuse in the final game 76–67. It was the Orangemen's second championship game loss under coach [[Jim Boeheim]], joining a 74-73 defeat vs. [[1986-87 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana]] in [[1987 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1987]] (Boeheim and Syracuse finally won the championship in [[2003 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2003]]). 

The championship game the second Final Four meeting between Pitino and Boeheim. Boeheim's Orangemen defeated Pitino's [[1986-87 Providence Friars men's basketball team|Providence Friars]] in the 1987 semifinals. 

[[Tony Delk]] of Kentucky was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. Kentucky's run to the championship was one of the most dominant in NCAA tournament history, as the Wildcats won each of their first four games by at least 20 points and won every game by at least 7 points.

Massachusetts, coached by [[John Calipari]], was later stripped of its wins, including the UMass Minutemen's Final Four appearance, by the NCAA because UMass star [[Marcus Camby]] had accepted illegal gifts from agents. Connecticut, coached by [[Jim Calhoun]], was additionally punished monetarily due to players accepting illegal gifts from agents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/09/sports/umass-and-uconn-lose-96-honors.html|title = UMass and UConn Lose '96 Honors|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 9 May 1997|last1 = Cavanaugh|first1 = Jack}}</ref>

The 1996 tournament was the last to feature teams from the Big Eight and Southwest Conferences; later that year the two would form the [[Big 12 Conference]]. As of 2022, they were the last Division I conferences to disband and/or merge after sending teams to the NCAA tournament.

As of 2024, this is the earliest tournament from which all four Final Four coaches (Pitino, Boeheim, Calipari and Mississippi State's Richard Williams) are still living. 

This was the last NCAA tournament in which officials wore collared shirts. A v-neck shirt, already worn in several conferences during the regular season, was adopted association-wide during the 1996-97 season.

Michigan's appearance in the 1996 NCAA tournament along with 20 regular season wins were vacated on November 7, 2002, as part of the settlement of the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]].  Unlike forfeiture, a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win, only with the removal of any Michigan wins from all records.

On May 8, 1997, the NCAA Executive Committee voted to negate the Minutemen's 1996 NCAA Tournament record, for [[Marcus Camby]]'s acceptance of agents' improper gifts. The team's 35–2 season record was reduced to 31–1, and the UMass slot in the Final Four is officially marked as "vacated". The Final Four trophy, banner, and 45% of tournament revenue were returned to the NCAA. Camby reimbursed the school for the lost revenue. Unlike forfeiture, a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win, only with UMass removing the wins from its own record.
