The '''2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament''' involved 68 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] that determined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[College basketball|basketball]] national champion for the [[2012–13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2012-13 season]]. The 75th annual edition of [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|the tournament]] (dating to 1939) began on March 19, 2013, and concluded with the [[2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|championship game]] on April 8, at the [[Georgia Dome]] in [[Atlanta]].

The Final Four consisted of [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (tenth overall appearance, eighth official appearance), [[Wichita State Shockers men's basketball|Wichita State]] (second appearance), [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]] (first appearance since their 2003 national championship), and [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]], returning for the first time since the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]]'s second appearance in 1993 (later vacated). By winning the West Region, [[2012–13 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team|Wichita State]] became the first #9 seed and first [[Missouri Valley Conference]] (MVC) team to reach the Final Four since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in [[1985 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1985]]. The last #9 seed to reach the Final Four was [[Penn Quakers men's basketball|Penn]], and the last MVC team to do so was [[1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball team|Indiana State]], both in [[1979 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1979]]. Louisville defeated Michigan in the championship game by a final score of 82–76, winning their first national title since 1986. On February 20, 2018, the NCAA automatically vacated Louisville's entire tournament run, including its national title, due to [[2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal|a 2015 sex scandal]].<ref name="Vacate">{{cite web|title=NCAA denies Louisville's appeal, rules Cardinals must vacate 2013 national title|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/22513517/ncaa-denies-louisville-appeal-rules-cardinals-vacate-2013-national-title|website=ESPN.com|date=February 20, 2018}}</ref> Although none of the other teams had their runs vacated by NCAA staff, this meant that in effect, the entire tournament was deemed null and void, with no national champion team crowned for the year. This would not happen again until 2020, when the competition, which ironically would have seen the Final Four held in Atlanta that year, was cancelled outright due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/ncaa-cancels-remaining-winter-and-spring-championships|title=NCAA cancels remaining winter and spring championships|date=March 12, 2020|website=NCAA.org|language=en|access-date=March 28, 2020}}</ref>

The tournament featured several notable upsets. For the first time since [[1991 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1991]], at least one team seeded #9 through #15 won at least once in the tournament. The most notable was [[Florida Gulf Coast Eagles men's basketball|Florida Gulf Coast University]] of the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]], who made their tournament debut in only their second year of Division I eligibility. They upset [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] and [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]] in their first two games, becoming the first #15 seed to advance to the regional semifinals (where they were defeated by [[Florida Gators men's basketball|Florida]]). For the first time since 2010, a #14 seed won as [[Harvard Crimson men's basketball|Harvard]] defeated [[New Mexico Lobos men's basketball|New Mexico]] in the West Region. The same region saw #13 [[La Salle Explorers men's basketball|La Salle]], who won in the opening round, defeat #4 [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]] and #12 [[Ole Miss Rebels men's basketball|Mississippi]] defeat #5 [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin]]. In addition to that, the region's top seed, [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]], was defeated in the round of 32 by eventual region winner Wichita State, who defeated La Salle in the Sweet Sixteen.

Two other teams also earned their first ever NCAA Tournament victory: [[Ivy League]] champion [[2012–13 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team|Harvard]] and [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference]] (MEAC) champion [[2012–13 North Carolina A&T Aggies men's basketball team|North Carolina A&T]]. Another school, [[2012–13 Liberty Flames basketball team|Liberty]], won the [[2013 Big South Conference men's basketball tournament|Big South tournament]] to become the second 20-loss team to make the field, after [[2007–08 Coppin State Eagles men's basketball team|Coppin State]] did that in 2008.

==Tournament procedure==
A total of 68 teams entered the 2013 tournament. A total of 32 automatic bids are awarded to each program that won a [[List of NCAA conferences#Division I|conference]] tournament. The remaining 36 bids are issued "at-large", with selections extended by the [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|NCAA Selection Committee]]. The Selection Committee also [[Seed (sports)|seeds]] the entire field from 1 to 68.

Eight teams—the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams—played in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as "[[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Opening Round game|play-in games]]" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the main tournament [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]].

===International===
[[ESPN International]] held broadcast rights to the tournament outside of the United States: it produced its own broadcasts of the semi-final and championship game, called by ''[[ESPN College Basketball]]'' personalities [[Brad Nessler]] (play-by-play), [[Dick Vitale]] (analyst for the final and one semi-final), and [[Jay Bilas]] (analyst for the other semi-final).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2013/02/dick-vitale-to-call-ncaa-final-four-games/|title=Dick Vitale to Call NCAA Final Four Games|first=Michael|last=Humes|work=ESPN MediaZone|date=February 5, 2013|access-date=March 23, 2013}}</ref> For the initial rounds, they use CBS/Turner coverage with an additional host to transition between games, with whiparound coverage similar to the CBS-only era. ESPN also has exclusive digital rights to the NCAA tournament outside of North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone3.com/wpmu/uk/?p=2421|title=NCAA® March Madness® Basketball Tournament live on ESPN America and ESPN Player|last=Berg|first=James|date=March 6, 2013|access-date=March 29, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527143457/http://espnmediazone3.com/wpmu/uk/?p=2421|archive-date=May 27, 2013}}</ref>

====Canada====
In Canada, the [[The Sports Network|TSN]] family of media outlets (including [[TSN2]], [[Réseau des sports|RDS]], and [[TSN Radio]]), which are part-owned by ESPN, own broadcast rights to the tournament. TSN produces separate studio coverage with [[Kate Beirness]], [[Jack Armstrong (basketball)|Jack Armstrong]], [[Dan Shulman]] and [[Sam Mitchell (basketball)|Sam Mitchell]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bellmediapr.ca/tsn/releases/release.asp?id=16250&yyyy=2013|title=TSN and TSN2 Got Game with Complete Live Coverage in Canada of NCAA® MARCH MADNESS®, Beginning March 21|author=[[The Sports Network]]|date=March 18, 2013|access-date=March 23, 2013}}</ref> but simulcasts CBS/Turner game coverage for the first five rounds (and ESPN International coverage for the Final Four).

As in past years, TSN and TSN2 carry whiparound coverage (often in parallel) during the second, third and fourth rounds, in 2013 focusing when possible on games not being broadcast on CBS (as that network, but not the Turner channels, is also widely available in Canada).
