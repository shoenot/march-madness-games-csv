The '''1991 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 14, 1991, and ended with the [[1991 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 1 in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. A total of 63 games were played.

[[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]], coached by [[Mike Krzyzewski]], won a rematch of the previous year's national final matchup against undefeated UNLV 79–77 in the semifinal,<ref>{{YouTube|l8JmUVldKKA|1991 1991 NCAA Basketball Semifinal Game}}</ref> then won the national title with a 72–65 victory in the final game over [[1990–91 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], coached by [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]].<ref>{{YouTube|OnFFAuDeAIY|1991 NCAA basketball national championship game}}</ref> This was the first national championship game for Williams as a head coach. Kansas defeated Williams' mentor [[Dean Smith]] and North Carolina (where Williams later coached) in the semifinal. Kansas made its second trip to the national championship game in four seasons, the prior appearance being 1988 when they defeated [[1987–88 Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball team|Oklahoma]]. [[Christian Laettner]] of Duke was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].

This tournament marked the first time a #15 seed upset a #2 seed since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985, when Richmond accomplished against Syracuse in the East region. In addition, for the first time ever, at least one team seeded #9 through #15 won a first-round game. This feat would be followed in [[2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2013]], [[2016 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2016]], and [[2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2021]].

This tournament adopted the [[NBA]]'s 10ths-second timer during the final minute of each period in all arenas.

==Teams==
There were 26 automatic bids awarded to the tournament - of these, 23 were given to the winners of their conference's tournament, while three were awarded to the team with the best regular-season record in their conference ([[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], [[Ivy League]] and [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10]]). Another 35 bids were awarded by the NCAA tournament committee at-large to the best teams in the nation not already qualified.

The [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]] was eligible for an automatic bid to the tournament, but their conference tournament was won by [[1990–91 Missouri Tigers men's basketball team|Missouri]], who were on probation and ineligible for the NCAA tournament.<ref>{{cite web |title=Doug Smith rules Big Eight Tournament |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/03/10/Doug-Smith-rules-Big-Eight-Tournament/6426668581200/ |work=UPI Archives |date=March 10, 1991 |access-date=May 25, 2023}}</ref> No automatic bid was awarded to the Big Eight.

===Play-in Games===
The remaining three bids were decided by play-in games between the six lowest-rated conferences in the nation. These matchups, which were decided prior to the season, paired the tournament champions of the six lowest-rated conferences in the nation in games played at campus sites:<ref>{{cite web |title=Despite losing automatic bid, MEAC will get money |last=McCann |first=Gary |url=https://greensboro.com/despite-losing-automatic-bid-meac-will-get-money/article_867ac1b8-da15-5f61-ba07-2c31ebb95914.html |work=[[Greensboro News & Record]] |date=May 17, 1990 |access-date=May 25, 2023}}</ref>

* The winner of the [[1991 Northeast Conference men's basketball tournament|NEC tournament]], [[1990–91 Saint Francis Red Flash men's basketball team|Saint Francis (PA)]], hosted the winner of the [[1991 Patriot League men's basketball tournament|Patriot League tournament]], {{cbb link|1990|team=Fordham Rams|title=Fordham}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=BASKETBALL; Fordham's Road to N.C.A.A.

* The winner of the [[1991 Southland Conference men's basketball tournament|Southland tournament]], [[1990–91 Northeast Louisiana Indians men's basketball team|Northeast Louisiana]], hosted the winner of the [[1991 MEAC men's basketball tournament|MEAC tournament]], [[1990–91 Florida A&M Rattlers basketball team|Florida A&M]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Northeast Louisiana 87, Florida A&M 63 |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/03/06/Northeast-Louisiana-87-Florida-AM-63/1338668235600/ |work=UPI Archives |date=March 6, 1991 |access-date=May 25, 2023}}</ref>
* The winner of the [[1991 SWAC men's basketball tournament|SWAC tournament]], {{cbb link|1990|sex=none|team=Jackson State Tigers|title=Jackson State}}, hosted the winner of the [[1991 Big South Conference men's basketball tournament|Big South tournament]], [[1990–91 Coastal Carolina Chanticleers men's basketball team|Coastal Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Coastal Carolina 78, Jackson State 59 |url=https://greensboro.com/coastal-carolina-78-jackson-state-59/article_4deb3025-a491-5685-8079-9cef3e63a9fd.html |work=[[Greensboro News & Record]] |date=March 6, 1991 |access-date=May 25, 2023}}</ref>

Unlike the later [[First Four|Opening Round and First Four games]], the play-in games were not considered part of the NCAA tournament. This meant that the winners of these games were not credited with an NCAA tournament win, and only the teams that advanced to the field of 64 were credited with an NCAA tournament appearance.

All three games were played on March 6, 1991.

==Broadcast information==
For the first time, [[CBS Sports]] showed all 63 tournament games. In the first three rounds, games were shown on a regional basis, except for one game each on Saturday and Sunday in the second round. Usual start times were noon and 7:30 or 8 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern time]] on each of the Thursdays and Fridays. During the weekend of the second round, the national telecast began at noon, with the regional windows (three on Saturday, two on Sunday) following. Although the times would be adjusted, the same basic format was in place until [[2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2010]]. As of [[2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2011]], the regional broadcasts have been replaced by simulcast feeds on non-broadcast networks owned by [[Turner Sports]].

==Miscellaneous==
*Duke's [[1991 Duke vs. UNLV men's basketball game|79–77 win]] over UNLV in the Final Four became one of the biggest upsets in tournament history. Duke was an 8-point underdog in the game. UNLV's juggernaut 1990–91 squad ranked #2 on [[ESPN Classic]]'s ''Who's #1?'' for Best Teams Not To Win a Title. UNLV was undefeated entering the 1991 tournament, which was unmatched until Wichita State in 2014 and [[2014–15 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in 2015. (Saint Joseph's went unbeaten in the 2004 regular season, finishing 27–0, but lost in their conference tournament before the NCAAs. [[Alcorn State Braves men's basketball|Alcorn State]] went unbeaten in the 1979 regular season, but got invited to the [[1979 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] since the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] did not have an automatic bid to the NCAAs, and lost to eventual winner [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] in the 2nd round. Indiana is the last team to win the championship undefeated in 1976).
*This was Duke's fourth (of five) consecutive Final Four trips, the first team to achieve such a feat since UCLA. Since freshmen were not eligible at the time of UCLA's run, Duke's [[Greg Koubek]] became the first player to play in four Final Fours, a record matched by Duke teammates [[Christian Laettner]] and Brian Davis the [[1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|next year]] when the team repeated as national champions.
*For the first time in tournament history a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed. [[1990–91 Richmond Spiders men's basketball team|Richmond]] defeated Syracuse 73–69. Since then this has happened ten additional times: in 1993, Santa Clara defeated Arizona 64–61; in 1997, Coppin State defeated South Carolina 78–65; in 2001, [[Hampton University|Hampton]] defeated Iowa State 58–57; on the same day in 2012 Norfolk State defeated Missouri 86–84 and Lehigh defeated Duke 75–70; in 2013 Florida Gulf Coast defeated Georgetown 78–68;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=330810046|title = Florida Gulf Coast vs. Georgetown – Game Recap – March 22, 2013 – ESPN}}</ref> in 2016, Middle Tennessee defeated Michigan State 90–81; in 2021, [[Oral Roberts Golden Eagles men's basketball|Oral Roberts]] defeated Ohio State 75–72; in 2022, [[Saint Peter's Peacocks basketball|Saint Peter's]] defeated Kentucky 85–79; and in 2023, [[2022-23 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team|Princeton]] defeated Arizona 59–55.
*In the Final Four against [[1990–91 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], legendary [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] coach [[Dean Smith]] was ejected from the game for leaving the coach's box.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/31/sports/college-basketball-smith-ejected-on-2-technicals.html|title = College Basketball; Smith Ejected on 2 Technicals|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 31 March 1991|last1 = Smith|first1 = Timothy W.}}</ref>
*For [[bracketology|bracketologists]], this tournament is notable for several reasons. The first is the upset-heavy opening round, which led to every seed number except 16 being represented by at least one team in the second round. The East region, in particular, featured first round victories by seeds 9, 10, 12, 13, and 15. Two 11's and a 14-seed advanced in the other regions. The second round is equally remarkable because there were ''no upsets'' in this round whatsoever. The combination of these two anomalies led to an unprecedented occurrence in which a 10 ([[Temple University|Temple]]), an 11 ([[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]]), and a 12-seed ([[Eastern Michigan University|Eastern Michigan]]) advanced to the Sweet Sixteen without any of the teams pulling off consecutive upsets. The reason for this was that the first round successes of 15-seed [[University of Richmond|Richmond]], 14-seed [[Xavier University (Cincinnati)|Xavier]], and 13-seed [[Penn State]] led to Temple, Connecticut, and Eastern Michigan (respectively) being considered ''favorites'' for their second round matchups.
*This was the first NCAA Tournament to feature all four of the [[North Carolina]]–based [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] teams, also known as the [[Tobacco Road (rivalry)|Tobacco Road]] or [[Big Four Tournament|Big Four]] teams: [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], [[NC State Wolfpack basketball|NC State]], [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] and [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]].
*The Final Four was also the first to include both halves of the [[Carolina–Duke rivalry|North Carolina–Duke rivalry]]. Had both teams won, they would have faced each other for the national championship, but to this day, the teams have only faced each other once each in the NCAA tournament and the NIT – the [[1971 National Invitation Tournament|1971 NIT]] semifinals at Madison Square Garden, which North Carolina won 73–67 and the [[2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2022 Final Four]] at the Caesars Superdome, which the [[Carolina–Duke_rivalry#April 2, 2022: (#8 East) North Carolina 81, #9 (#2 West) Duke 77|8th-seeded Tar Heels won 81–77]] in the last game of [[Mike Krzyzewski]]'s coaching career.
*This tournament featured three play-in games before the tournament field was announced, featuring the champions of the six conferences with the lowest computer ratings the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/06/sports/basketball-fordham-takes-aim-at-an-ncaa-berth.html |title=Fordham takes aim at an NCAA berth |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Malcolm |last=Moran |date=March 6, 1991 |access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> The results were: [[1990–91 Saint Francis Red Flash men's basketball team|Saint Francis, Pennsylvania]] ([[Northeast Conference|NEC]]) defeated [[Fordham Rams men's basketball|Fordham]] ([[Patriot League|Patriot]]) 70–64,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/07/sports/basketball-fordham-s-road-to-ncaa-blocked-by-st-francis-70-64.html |title=Fordham's road to NCAA blocked by St. Francis, 70–64 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Malcolm |last=Moran |date=March 7, 1991 |access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> [[1990–91 Coastal Carolina Chanticleers men's basketball team|Coastal Carolina]] ([[Big South Conference|Big South]]) over [[Jackson State Tigers basketball|Jackson State]] ([[Southwestern Athletic Conference|SWAC]]) 78–59,<ref name=NELA>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/07/sports/basketball-northeast-louisiana-wins-ncaa-bid.html |title=Northeast Louisiana wins NCAA bid |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 7, 1991 |access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> and [[1990–91 Northeast Louisiana Indians men's basketball team|NE Louisiana]] ([[Southland Conference|Southland]]) over [[Florida A&M Rattlers basketball|Florida A&M]] ([[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference|MEAC]]) 87–63.<ref name=NELA/> These are not opening round games and the losers are not credited with an NCAA tournament appearance.
* UNLV's semi-final loss in the NCAA tournament brought an end to their astounding 45-game win streak. That is the fourth-longest consecutive-game win streak in NCAA Division 1 basketball history, and the longest win streak since the longest one ever (by UCLA) ended in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-01-19/longest-winning-streaks-college-basketball-history|title=The longest winning streaks in college basketball history &#124; NCAA.com|website=www.ncaa.com}}</ref>
*DePaul's appearance is, as of 2023, the last appearance of an independent team in the tournament. The Blue Demons would join the [[Great Midwest Conference]] in 1991; [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]], the last prominent independent, would join the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East]] in 1995. Though there have been independent teams since, most have been minor programs, or programs in transition between conference affiliations and divisions. It was also the last tournament to feature an East Coast Conference team; the conference, which was born in 1974 from former Middle Atlantic Conference teams, would cease operations in 1994 after most of the teams joined larger conferences.
*Until [[2025 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2025]]  This was the only time that [[Saint Francis Red Flash men's basketball|Saint Francis (PA)]] appeared at the tournament.
