The '''1987 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 12, 1987, and ended with the [[1987 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on March 30 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. A total of 63 games were played.

[[1986–87 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana]], coached by [[Bob Knight]], won the national title with a 74–73 victory in the final game over [[1986–87 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team|Syracuse]], coached by [[Jim Boeheim]]. [[Keith Smart]] of Indiana, who hit the game-winner in the final seconds, and intercepted the full court pass at the last second, was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].

The tournament also featured a "Cinderella team" in the Final Four, as [[Providence College]], led by a then-unknown [[Rick Pitino]], made their first Final Four appearance since 1973.

One year after reaching the [[1986 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|Final Four]] as a #11 seed, [[LSU Tigers men's basketball|LSU]] made another deep run as a #10 seed in the Midwest region. The Tigers ousted #2 seed Temple in the second round and #3 seed DePaul in the Sweet 16 before losing 77–76 to top seeded Indiana in the Elite Eight.

This was the last tournament in which teams were allowed to have home court advantage: national runner-up Syracuse (2E), DePaul (3MW), Arizona (10W) and UAB (11SE) all opened the tournament playing on their home courts. UAB and Arizona each lost in the first round, while DePaul won twice at the [[Rosemont Horizon]]. Under rules adopted in [[1988 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1988]], teams cannot play in a facility in which they play four or more regular season games.

The 1987 NCAA men's basketball tournament was also the first tournament to use the [[Three-point field goal|three-point shot]].

==Trivia==
* The [[59th Academy Awards]] show was broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]] at the same time as [[College Basketball on CBS|CBS network]] broadcast of the championship game between Indiana and Syracuse. Oscars show host [[Chevy Chase]] quipped later in the evening, "Is the game over yet?" The Oscars show would subsequently be scheduled around the tournament broadcast by moving it later in April for two years.
* Tenth seeded LSU reached the Elite Eight for the second straight year without being favored to win a game. This time, the Tigers did not have the advantage of playing their first- and second-round games on their [[Pete Maravich Assembly Center|home court]]. They had previously reached the Final Four as an 11-seed in 1986, losing to eventual national champion Louisville Cardinals. The Tigers missed a shot at the buzzer and fell short of another trip to the Final Four, losing 77–76 to eventual national champion Indiana. It marked the fifth time in seven tournament appearances between 1979 and 1987 LSU was eliminated by the eventual national champion. The Tigers did not reach the  Elite Eight again until [[2006 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2006]].
* Years after the end of the tournament, Alabama, DePaul, Florida, Marshall, and North Carolina State all had their tournament spots vacated by the NCAA retroactively.<ref>{{cite web |title=2015 MEN'S FINAL FOUR RECORDS BOOK |url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_final4/2015/3Tournament.pdf |access-date=June 5, 2024}}</ref>
* This marked the first time that [[CBS Sports]] used "[[One Shining Moment]]" during their tournament epilogue. Initially, the song was supposed to have been played after [[Super Bowl XXI]] (which was also aired on CBS), but due to time constraints, its debut was delayed until the national championship game. The opening words for the football version were "The ball is kicked"; in the reworked version, the word "kicked" was changed to "tipped" to suit the tournament.
* The three losing coaches in the Final Four all eventually won national titles. Jerry Tarkanian was the first to do so, winning in [[1990 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1990]] with [[1989–90 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV]] defeating [[1989–90 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] 103–73. Rick Pitino followed in [[1996 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1996]] with [[1995–96 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], defeating Jim Boeheim's [[1995–96 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team|Syracuse]] in the final. Boeheim would win in [[2003 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2003]] with [[2002–03 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team|Syracuse]] by defeating [[2002–03 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]].
* There were no teams from the [[Metro Conference]], [[Big South Conference]] or [[Gulf Star Conference]] in the tournament.  The Metro Conference allowed [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis State]], which was serving an NCAA tournament ban that year, to compete in its conference tournament, which it won by defeating the defending 1986 National Champion [[Louisville Cardinals]] by the lopsided score 75 to 52 on the Cardinals' home court, Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky.  The NCAA basketball tournament committee said as the conference had committed its automatic berth would go to its conference tournament winner, the conference lost its automatic berth that year, and no other schools received an at-large entry.  Most conferences now prohibit teams on postseason bans from participating in conference tournaments as a result, or have provisional automatic bids awarded to the eligible team that advanced the most. The Gulf Star and Big South did not have automatic bids to the tournament because many of the schools in these conferences were transitioning from other divisions.
* During the selection show, there was a spot left open for the #12 seed in the Southeast Region. [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], the 5th seed in the region, was due to face either [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]] or [[Houston Cougars|Houston]] in the first round. Washington was facing UCLA in the finals of the [[Pac-12|Pac-10]] tournament at the time the selections were announced. UCLA held on to defeat Washington 76–62, putting Houston into the field of 64.
* [[1986–87 Florida Gators men's basketball team|Florida]] made the NCAA Tournament for the first time, making it to the Sweet Sixteen. Coincidentally, [[1986–87 Providence Friars men's basketball team|Providence]] was led to the Final Four by [[Billy Donovan]], who would go on to coach the Gators to multiple Final Fours and 2 national titles.
* For the second time in 5 years, a rule involving how the clock would run after a made basket played a massive role at the end of a title game. In 1983, N.C. State won the title on a dunk with 1 second left, as the clock ran through the dunk and ran out before Houston could do anything. In 1987, Syracuse players (either unaware of the clock-running post basket or freezing under pressure) let 4 seconds run off the clock after Keith Smart's made jumper; only 1 second was left when a timeout was called, and the Orangemen's last shot was missed to give Indiana the national title. For the 1993–94 season, the rules were permanently changed, so with 1 minute or less in a half or overtime the clock stops when a basket is made and doesn't start again until the ball is inbounded by the other team (regardless of whether they use a timeout first or not).
