The '''2004 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 65 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 16, 2004, and ended with the [[2004 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|championship game]] on April 5 at the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio]], Texas. A total of 64 games were played.

The NCAA named, for the first time, the four tournament regions after regional site host cities instead of the "East", "Midwest", "South", and "West" designations. It was also the first year that the matchups for the national semifinals were determined at least in part by the overall seeding of the top team in each regional {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The top four teams in the tournament were [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and [[Saint Joseph's University|Saint Joseph's]]. Had all of those teams advanced to the Final Four, Kentucky would have played Saint Joseph's and Duke would have played Stanford in the semifinal games.

Of those teams, only Duke advanced to the Final Four. They were joined by [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]], making their first appearance since defeating Duke for the national championship in 1999, [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma State]], making their first appearance since 1995, and [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Georgia Tech]], making their first appearance since 1990.

Connecticut defeated Georgia Tech 82–73 to win their second national championship in as many tries. [[Emeka Okafor]] of Connecticut was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].

As they had in 1999, Connecticut won their regional championship in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].

Two of the tournament's top seeds failed to make it past the opening weekend. Kentucky, number one seed of the St. Louis region, and Stanford, #1 seed of the Phoenix region, both were defeated. Incidentally, both teams were defeated by schools from Alabama, as Kentucky fell to UAB while Stanford lost to Alabama.

Due to their strong 2003–04 season, [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]] achieved its highest NCAA tournament seed until 2013 by receiving the #2 seed in the St. Louis region. Gonzaga would receive a #1 seed in the 2013 tournament. The team failed to advance beyond the first weekend of the tournament, however.

===National semifinals===
*April 3, 2004
**[[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]] (W2) 79, [[Duke University|Duke]] (S1) 78
* With the [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut Huskies]] trailing by 8 points with less than 3 minutes to go, it looked as if the [[Duke University|Duke Blue Devils]] were going to spoil [[Jim Calhoun]]'s chance at a second national title. Connecticut's All-American center [[Emeka Okafor]] was limited to just 22 minutes because of early foul trouble, but he came up clutch with several big plays down the stretch and finished with 18 points and only 3 fouls. By contrast, all three of Duke's centers fouled out, including [[Shelden Williams]], who committed his fifth foul with 3:04 to play. In addition, Duke went without a field goal for the last 4{{sfrac|1|2}} minutes until [[Chris Duhon]]'s meaningless three-pointer at the buzzer. Duke coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]] was denied his 65th NCAA Tournament victory which would have tied him with [[Dean Smith]] for the all-time record. He later broke that record.<ref name="CNNSI4.3-1">{{cite news|work=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/ncaa/men/recaps/2004/04/03/10225_recap.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040406020432/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/ncaa/men/recaps/2004/04/03/10225_recap.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 6, 2004|title=2004 NCAA National semifinals: (W2) Connecticut 79, (S1) Duke 78|access-date=March 6, 2008}}</ref>
**[[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] (M3) 67, [[Oklahoma State University – Stillwater|Oklahoma State]] (E2) 65
*:[[Will Bynum]]'s layup in the final moments kept the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] dream for a National Championship alive as they defeated the [[Oklahoma State University – Stillwater|Oklahoma State Cowboys]], in a nail-biter, in the first of the national semifinal doubleheader. Georgia Tech led for most of the game including a seven-point edge at halftime. However, Oklahoma State was able to tie the game on [[John Lucas III|John Lucas]]'s three-pointer with 26.3 seconds left. Georgia Tech then milked the clock which set up Bynum's game-winner. Georgia Tech advanced to their first ever National Championship appearance. Oklahoma State coach [[Eddie Sutton]] was denied yet another chance at an elusive national title.<ref name="CNNSI4.3-2">{{cite news|work=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/ncaa/men/recaps/2004/04/03/10224_recap.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407154140/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/ncaa/men/recaps/2004/04/03/10224_recap.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 7, 2004|title=2004 NCAA National semifinals: (MW3) Georgia Tech 67, (E2) Oklahoma State 65|access-date=March 6, 2008}}</ref>
