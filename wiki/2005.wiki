The '''2005 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 65 schools playing in single-elimination play to determine the national champion of men's NCAA Division I [[college basketball]]. It began on March 15, 2005, and ended with the [[2005 NCAA men's Division I basketball championship game|championship game]] on April 4 at the [[Edward Jones Dome]] in [[St. Louis]].

North Carolina emerged as the national champion for a fourth time, defeating Illinois in the final 75–70.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|title = May's big day helps Williams win first national title|url = http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=254000063|archive-url = https://archive.today/20160328180019/http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=254000063|url-status = dead|archive-date = March 28, 2016|website = ESPN.com|access-date = 2016-02-16}}</ref> North Carolina's [[Sean May]] was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].<ref name=":2" /> It was coach [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]]'s first national championship.<ref name=":2" />

==Tournament procedure==
{{Further|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Tournament format}}
A total of 65 teams entered the tournament, thirty having earned automatic bids by winning their [[list of college athletic conferences|conference]] tournaments. The automatic bid of the [[Ivy League]], which does not conduct a postseason tournament, went to its regular season champion. The remaining 34 teams were granted "at-large" bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.

Two teams play an opening-round game, popularly called the "[[NCAA men's Division I basketball opening round|play-in game]]," the winner of which advances to the main draw of the tournament and plays a top seed in one of the regionals. Since its inception in 2001, this game has been played at the [[University of Dayton Arena]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].

All 64 teams were seeded 1 to 16 within their regionals; the winner of the play-in game automatically received a 16 seed. The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] seeded the entire field from 1 to 65.

The 2005 regionals, along with their top seeds, are listed below.
*'''Chicago Regional''' (top seed: [[2005 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team|Illinois]]; top overall seed)
*'''Albuquerque Regional''' (top seed: [[Washington Huskies|Washington]]; fourth overall seed)
*'''Syracuse Regional''' (top seed: [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]]; second overall seed)
*'''Austin Regional''' (top seed: [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]; third overall seed)

Each regional winner advanced to the [[Final Four]], held April 2–4 in St. Louis.

====Semifinals====
*March 24
**[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|Illinois]] (1) 77, [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee|Milwaukee]] (12) 63
**:Milwaukee, who had knocked off powerhouses Alabama and Boston College in the last week, had their Cinderella run come to an abrupt end against the tournament's top-seeded team. Milwaukee stayed with Illinois for most of the first half, only trailing 29–26 with 3:38 to play in the half, but then Illinois reeled off a 7–0 run to push the lead to ten, and Milwaukee never recovered, never getting closer than seven points for the rest of the game. Following this impressive run, Milwaukee coach [[Bruce Pearl]] accepted a job as the head basketball coach at the [[University of Tennessee]].
**[[University of Arizona|Arizona]] (3) 79, [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater|Oklahoma State]] (2) 78
**:In the other and more climactic Midwest Regional semifinal, Arizona squeaked by Oklahoma State when [[Salim Stoudamire]] canned a jumper with 2.8 seconds remaining. The game had been back-and-forth all night long, with Arizona leading by three at halftime but then letting up, allowing Oklahoma State to take a five-point lead at 72–67 with 4:29 remaining. Arizona and Oklahoma State then traded baskets, and Stoudamire sliced the Oklahoma State lead to 76–75 with 1:58 left on a three-pointer. After [[Joey Graham]] put Oklahoma State back up by one with eighteen seconds to play, Stoudamire nailed his game-winner to send Arizona to the Regional Finals.

====Final====
*March 26
**[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|Illinois]] (1) 90, [[University of Arizona|Arizona]] (3) 89 (OT)
**:In one of the most thrilling NCAA basketball games ever, Illinois pulled off an improbable comeback to break the hearts of Wildcats fans everywhere. After a close first half, Arizona came out gunning in the second half, opening up a 75–60 lead with only four minutes left in the second half. Illinois then closed the half on a 20–5 run to force overtime using a stingy defense, layups, and three-pointers, the last of which by [[Deron Williams]] tied the game at 80–80 with 39 seconds in regulation. The run broke down Arizona completely, and Illinois opened up a 90–84 lead in overtime before Arizona scored five straight to cut the lead to one, but [[Hassan Adams]] missed a three at the buzzer to give Illinois the win and a berth in the Final Four.

Washington tried a second-half comeback, cutting Louisville's lead to 67–61 with 8:41 left, but Louisville had enough to pull away.
**[[West Virginia University|West Virginia]] (7) 65, [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]] (6) 60
**:Seventh-seeded West Virginia continued to roll onto the Regional Finals, engaging in a close battle with Texas Tech before pulling away in the second half.

====Final====
*March 26
**[[University of Louisville|Louisville]] (4) 93, [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]] (7) 85 (OT)
**:In another Regional Final overtime game (and a preview of a future [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East]] rivalry), West Virginia opened up the game at a blistering pace, using five three-pointers to jump out to a 19–5 lead. When [[Johannes Herber|Joe Herber]] made a three, West Virginia had a 32–13 lead with 5:30 to play in the first half. West Virginia led by thirteen at halftime, but Louisville finally went to a zone defense coming out of the half, and West Virginia began to go cold. Louisville cut the lead to three nine minutes into the second half, but [[Kevin Pittsnogle]] extended the West Virginia lead to ten with six minutes to play with a three. But West Virginia missed their last four field goals and Louisville tied the game with 38 seconds to play on [[Larry O'Bannon]]'s layup. Louisville had grabbed the momentum and scored sixteen points in overtime to secure a berth in the Final Four.

===Syracuse Regional===
At [[Carrier Dome]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]

====Semifinals====
*March 25
**[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]] (1) 67, [[Villanova University|Villanova]] (5) 66
**:In a tight Sweet Sixteen contest, the top-seeded Tar Heels barely made it to the Regional Finals. The entire game was officiated closely—the first television timeout came after Villanova garnered its fifth personal foul, and two fouls led to the disqualification from the game of North Carolina star Raymond Felton with under five minutes left. Fifth-seeded Villanova stuck with UNC despite falling behind 64–54 with 3:45 left in the game. The Wildcats stormed back to cut the lead to 66–63. With eleven seconds left Allan Ray drove the lane, received contact as he made a basket, but was called for a travel on the play. On the ensuing possession, Villanova immediately fouled. Rashad McCants then made a free throw to seal the North Carolina victory.
**[[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]] (6) 65, [[North Carolina State University|N.C. State]] (10) 56
**:After upsetting two higher-seeded teams, including the defending national champion, N.C. State took a nine-point halftime lead against sixth-seeded Wisconsin before the Badgers woke up, using a 13–0 second-half run to turn a three-point deficit into a ten-point lead. N.C. State hung in, cutting the Wisconsin lead to 53–49 with 5:03 to play, and then only trailed 59–54 with 1:50 to play, but N.C. State ran out of miracles and energy and their Cinderella run ended, denying them a matchup with their most hated rival for a trip to St. Louis.

====Final====
*March 27
**[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]] (1) 88, [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]] (6) 82
**:The third regional final matched up the top seeded North Carolina Tar Heels and the sixth seeded Badgers from Wisconsin. The Tar Heels started off hot in this one as Sean May and Rashad McCants scored at will. When point guard Raymond Felton garnered his second foul, head coach Roy Williams decided to pull him to prevent further foul trouble. Up 11 at the time, it seemed to be the right move. Wisconsin would prove Williams wrong as they finished the half on an 11–0 run, tying the game at 44 heading into the half. The Tar Heels struggled to start the second half as hot as the first and trailed for the first time since the opening minutes of the game. Sparked by May's 29 points and 11 boards and Felton's clutch free throws, they outlasted the Badgers and won the game by six in regulation.

===Austin Regional===
At [[Frank Erwin Center]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]

====Semifinals====
*March 25
**[[Michigan State University|Michigan State]] (5) 78, [[Duke University|Duke]] (1) 68
**:The Spartans of Michigan State continued on to the Regional Finals by outplaying Duke in the second half and breaking a 32–32 halftime tie. Michigan State came out in the second half and secured the momentum in slowly, but surely, pulling away from Duke. The Spartans got out to a nine-point lead, allowed Duke to get within two, but then, scoring their last ten points of the game on free throws, moved on to the Regional Finals.
**[[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]] (2) 62, [[University of Utah|Utah]] (6) 52
**:After playing Kentucky well in the first half, only trailing by five at halftime, Utah ran out of steam. Utah's last chance to win the game came after [[Andrew Bogut]] missed a free throw with Utah down 38–35 with 12:17 to play. Kentucky gradually pulled away to meet Michigan State in the Regional Finals.

====Final====
*March 27
**[[Michigan State University|Michigan State]] (5) 94, [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]] (2) 88 (2 OT)
**:In this double-overtime thriller, Kentucky started out well and led Michigan State by four at halftime, but Michigan State caught up in the second half, actually leading 70–62 with 5:43 to play. Kentucky rallied back, however, cutting the lead to one when [[Kelenna Azubuike]] drained a three with 1:19 to play. After Patrick Sparks missed the front end of a one-and-one with 41 seconds to play, Michigan State's Shannon Brown appeared to ice the game with two free throws with 20 seconds to play. But with time expiring, Sparks put up a prayer from three, and the ball bounced around the rim four times before falling in. After the referees spent nearly ten minutes reviewing the play, they upheld that Sparks' shot was a three pointer, sending the game into overtime. In the first overtime, neither team relented, and Brown hit a key three-point basket for Michigan State to keep them in the game. Kentucky's Azubuike missed a three as time expired to send the game into double overtime. In the second overtime, Michigan State's mettle finally won the game for them, as they scored 11 of their 13 points from the free throw line to finally seal the game and send them to the Final Four for the fourth time under coach [[Tom Izzo]].

===National semifinals===
*April 2
**[[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|Illinois]] (Chicago 1) 72, [[University of Louisville|Louisville]] (Albuquerque 4) 57
*:In a packed Edwards Jones Dome, the battle between Chicago Regional Champions Illinois and Albuquerque Regional Champions Louisville took place. Although nearly three-fourths of the crowd were Illini fans, the fourth-seeded Louisville Cardinals were not fazed and gave the overall top-seeded Fighting Illini all they could handle, trailing only by three at halftime, but Illinois used an early second-half run to pull away from the Cardinals and earn a bid in the national championship game.
**[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]] (Syracuse 1) 87, [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]] (Austin 5) 71
*:In the battle between Syracuse Regional Champions North Carolina and Austin Regional Champions Michigan State, North Carolina used a 54-point second half to erase a five-point halftime deficit and down the Spartans, who were making their fourth appearance in the Final Four under coach [[Tom Izzo]].

===National Championship Game===

*April 4
**[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]] (Syracuse 1) 75, [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|Illinois]] (Chicago 1) 70
North Carolina was looking for its 4th National Championship, while Illinois was playing in its first. It was a tight contest for much of the first half before an 8–0 run by North Carolina allowed them to take a 35–25 lead. Eventually they would take a 40–27 lead into halftime. North Carolina increased its lead to 15 at one point in the second half. But Illinois began a furious charge: at one point, they would hit seven consecutive shots from the floor to turn a fifteen-point lead back to four. Unfazed, North Carolina would push the lead back up to ten before a 10–0 run by the Illini tied the game at 65-65. Illinois would tie the game at 70–70 on a three by Luther Head. But North Carolina would fight back as freshman Marvin Williams tapped back a Rashad McCants missed shot to put North Carolina back in front. Illinois would get several cracks to take the lead but were unable to convert. Eventually, Raymond Felton was able to steal the ball from Head, forcing Deron Williams to foul. However, Felton converted on 1 of 2 free throws, giving Illinois one last chance. But Luther Head's three pointer bounced high and out. Eventually it went into the hands of Felton who this time connected on both free throws to give North Carolina a 75–70 victory. For North Carolina head coach Roy Williams, it was his first national championship. Illinois was denied a chance to set the NCAA record for most wins in a season, instead tying it at 37. Sean May scored 26 points as he took the MOP of the Final Four.
