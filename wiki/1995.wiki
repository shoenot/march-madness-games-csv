The '''1995 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 16, 1995, and ended with the [[1995 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 3 at the [[Seattle Kingdome|Kingdome]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. This Final Four would be the last time that the Final Four was hosted in the [[Western United States]] until the [[2017 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2017 edition of the tournament]] where [[Glendale, Arizona]] was the host. A total of 63 games were played.

The Final Four consisted of [[1994–95 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]], making their fifteenth appearance and first since the 1980 team that eventually saw their appearance vacated, [[1994–95 Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball team|Oklahoma State]], making their fifth appearance and first since 1951, [[1994–95 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]], making their twelfth appearance and second in three years, and [[1994–95 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team|Arkansas]], the defending national champions.

The championship game saw UCLA win their eleventh national championship and first (and only) national title under [[Jim Harrick]] by defeating Arkansas 89–78, foiling the Razorbacks' hopes of back to back national titles.

UCLA's [[Ed O'Bannon]] was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].

==Notes==
* March 19, 1995 – A final shot in the second round at [[Taco Bell Arena|The Boise State Pavilion]] is one of the most memorable moments in NCAA history. UCLA's [[Tyus Edney]] dashed the length of the 94-foot court in just over 4 seconds to make a layup that gave the Bruins a 75–74 win over Missouri, which sustained UCLA's run to a national title that year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Friend |first=Tom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/20/sports/ncaa-tournament-west-ucla-dash-knocks-wind-out-of-missouri.html?pagewanted=1 |title=N.C.A.A. TOURNAMENT: WEST; U.C.L.A. Dash Knocks Wind Out of Missouri |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 20, 1995 |quote=U.C.L.A.'s Tyus Edney ran a 94-foot dash in 4.7 seconds today.

* April 3, 1995 – Ed O'Bannon scored 30&nbsp;points and grabbed 17&nbsp;rebounds and is named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] as the Bruins win the championship 89–78 over [[1994–95 Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball team|Arkansas]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Penner |first=Mike |title=Sweetness in Seattle |date=April 4, 1995 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-04-04-sp-50913-story.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701123543/http://articles.latimes.com/print/1995-04-04/sports/sp-50913_1_championship-game |archive-date=July 1, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Cameron Dollar]] played 36 minutes and contributed eight assists and four steals while filling in for an injured Edney, who did not return after leaving with 17:23 left in the first half.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dufresne |first=Chris |title=A Big Return From Dollar |date=April 4, 1995 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-04-04-sp-50898-story.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710144534/http://articles.latimes.com/print/1995-04-04/sports/sp-50898_1_guard-ucla |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Bruins enjoyed the biggest lead 34–26 in the first half, but led only by a point at halftime 40–39.
* To date, this is the last NCAA men's basketball tournament in which no team seeded lower than #6 reached the Sweet Sixteen.
* Five teams - [[Colgate Raiders men's basketball|Colgate]], [[FIU Panthers men's basketball|FIU]], [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]], [[Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers men's basketball|Mount St. Mary's]] and [[Nicholls Colonels men's basketball|Nicholls State]] - made their debut in this tournament, all as conference winners. Only FIU has failed to return to the tournament since; Gonzaga would miss the next three tournaments before starting their current streak of making every tournament since 1999.
* The 1995 tournament was the last to feature teams from the Metro and Great Midwest Conferences, as the two would merge later that year to form [[Conference USA]].
** [[Tulane Green Wave men's basketball|Tulane]], a charter member of the Metro (expelled from the conference from 1985 to 1989 when the Green Wave shuttered their men's basketball program in the wake of a  [[point shaving]] scandal), has not returned to the NCAA tournament since.
