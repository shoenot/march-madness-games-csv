The '''1985 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. This was the first year the field was expanded to 64 teams, from 53 in the previous year's tournament. It began on March 14, 1985, and ended with the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 1 in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. A total of 63 games were played.

Eighth-seed [[1984–85 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]], coached by [[Rollie Massimino]], won their first national title with a 66–64 victory in the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|final game]] over [[1984–85 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]], coached by [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]]. [[Ed Pinckney]] of Villanova was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. The game, often cited as "The Perfect Game", is widely considered among the greatest upsets in college basketball history, and is the second biggest point-spread upset in Championship Game history.<ref>[https://www.si.com/longform/2015/1985/villanova/ Sports Illustrated]</ref><ref>[http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/31-years-later-villanova-wildcats-played-another-perfect-game-at-the-final-four-oklahoma-buddy-hield USA Today]</ref> This Villanova team remains the lowest-seeded team to win the tournament. The Wildcats are also notable as the last Division I men's national champion to date to represent a school that did not sponsor varsity [[College football|football]] at the time of its title (Villanova had dropped [[Villanova Wildcats football|football]] after the 1980 season and did not reinstate the sport until the 1985 season, the first after the championship game). The game is also notable as the last played without a [[shot clock]].

This year's Final Four saw an unprecedented and unmatched three teams from the same conference, with [[Big East Conference|Big East]] members Villanova and Georgetown joined by [[1984–85 St. John's Redmen basketball team|St. John's]]. The only "interloper" in the Big East party was [[1984–85 Memphis State Tigers men's basketball team|Memphis State]], then of the [[Metro Conference]] (Memphis State's 1985 Final Four appearance was vacated due to using ineligible players, as were all of its tournament appearances from 1982 to 1986). [[Lehigh Mountain Hawks men's basketball|Lehigh]], champion of the [[East Coast Conference (Division I)|East Coast Conference]] Tournament, became the first team in NCAA Tournament history to compete with a record below .500, as they were 12–18 at the time they played in the First Round.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Teams with the worst records to make the men's NCAA tournament {{!}} NCAA.com |url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/bracketiq/2022-02-18/march-madness-history-teams-worst-records-make-ncaa-tournament |access-date=2023-04-03 |website=www.ncaa.com |language=en}}</ref>

This was also the first year that one of the regionals was named "Southeast", replacing "Mideast". This name was used until [[1998 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1998]], when the regional was renamed "South". This was also the last tournament until 2010 to feature two private schools in the title game. This tournament was also the last until 2012 to feature no teams in the Sweet 16 from the Mountain or Pacific Time Zones. No metropolitan area as small as Lexington has hosted the Final Four to date, though Lexington has hosted regionals throughout the years.
