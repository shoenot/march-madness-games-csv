==Qualifying and selection procedure==
{{further|2016 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament qualifying teams}}
Out of 336 eligible Division I teams, 68 participate in the tournament. Of the total, 15 Division I teams were ineligible due to failing to meet [[Academic Progress Rate|APR]] requirements, self-imposed postseason bans, or reclassification from a lower division.{{ref|a}}

Of the 32 automatic bids, 31 were given to programs that won their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournaments. For the final time, the [[Ivy League]] awarded its NCAA Tournament bid to the team with the best regular-season record and did not hold a tournament (unless playoffs games were needed to resolve tied champions). The Ivy League will hold a postseason tournament for the first time after the 2016–17 Ivy League season.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017 |title=The Ivy League Adds Men's, Women's Basketball Tournaments Beginning in 2017 |publisher=[[Ivy League]] |date=March 10, 2016 |access-date=March 10, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311041901/http://ivyleaguesports.com/information/general_releases/2015-16/releases/The_Ivy_League_Adds_Mens-Womens_Basketball_Tournaments_Beginning_in_2017 |archive-date=March 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The remaining 36 bids were granted on an "at-large" basis, which were extended by the NCAA Selection Committee to the teams it deems to be the best 36 teams that did not receive automatic bids.

Eight teams—the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams—played in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as "[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round game|play-in games]]" through the [[2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2010 tournament]]). The winners of these games advanced to the first round (round of 64). The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/mens-basketball-selections-101-selections|title=Men's Basketball Selections 101 – Selections|work=NCAA – The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref>

The Villanova–Oklahoma result was not only the most one-sided in the tournament so far, but also in the history of the men's Final Four. The Wildcats shot 71.4% for the game, surpassed in Final Four games only by the [[1984–85 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Wildcats']] 78.6% performance in the [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|1985 final]] against [[1984–85 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]]. The 44-point margin was also greater than the combined margin of defeat in Oklahoma's seven previous losses in 2015–16. In addition, the 2016 semifinals were the first since 2008 to both be decided by double-digit margins, and the combined 61-point margin broke a men's Final Four record set in 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/why-the-2016-ncaa-final-four-could-be-the-worst-ever-055156530.html?soc_src=mail&soc_trk=ma |title=Why the 2016 NCAA Final Four could be the worst ever |first=Pat |last=Forde |author-link=Pat Forde |publisher=[[Yahoo!

By winning the Midwest Regional final, [[2015–16 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]] became the first No. 10 seed in history to advance to the Final Four. However, six lower seeds, all No. 11, have advanced to that stage (in [[1986 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1986]], [[2006 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2006]], [[2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2011]], [[2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2018]], [[2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2021]],  and [[2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2024]].<ref name="auto2">{{cite web|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/syracuse-becomes-first-no-10-seed-to-reach-final-four/|title=Syracuse becomes first No. 10 seed to reach Final Four|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|access-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref>

This Tournament marked the first championship for Villanova in 31 years. It was also the first championship by a school without a [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] [[College football|football]] team since [[1998–99 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|Connecticut]] in [[1999 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1999]]. Villanova fields a [[NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]] [[Villanova Wildcats football|football team]], as did [[UConn Huskies football|UConn]] before [[2002 NCAA Division I-A football season|2002]].

===Upsets===
Per the NCAA, "Upsets are defined as when the winner of the game was seeded five or more places lower than the team it defeated." The 2016 tournament saw a total of 11 upsets; 8 of them were in the first round, 2 of them were in the second round, none in the Sweet Sixteen, and one in the Elite Eight.

==Media coverage==

===Television===
[[CBS Sports]] and [[Turner Sports]] held joint U.S. television broadcast rights to the Tournament under the [[NCAA March Madness (CBS/Turner)|''NCAA March Madness'']] brand. Beginning in 2016, rights to the Final Four and championship game began to alternate between Turner and CBS, with Turner networks broadcasting the 2016 Final Four and championship; a conventional telecast aired on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], accompanied by "Team Stream" broadcasts on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TruTV]] which featured commentary and coverage focused on each participating team. Turner employed this multi-channel presentation of the semifinals in 2014 and 2015, but this was the first time it was used for the final.<ref name="aa-commentators">{{cite web|title=CBS/Turner unveil 2016 NCAA Tournament announcers; Brian Anderson to call Elite Eight|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/cbsturner-unveil-2016-ncaa-tournament-announcers-brian-anderson-to-call-elite-eight.html|website=Awful Announcing|date=March 8, 2016 |access-date=March 9, 2016}}</ref> It marked the first time in tournament history that the national championship game aired on cable channels, and ended CBS' streak of broadcasting 34 consecutive National Championship games.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Sports, Turner Sports announce programming schedule for 2014, 2015|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2013-05-07/cbs-sports-turner-sports-announce-programming-schedule-2014|publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association|date=May 7, 2013|access-date=April 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110948/http://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2013-05-07/cbs-sports-turner-sports-announce-programming-schedule-2014|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Sports and Turner Sports Announce 2016 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Commentator Team|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2016-03-08/cbs-sports-and-turner-sports-announce-2016-ncaa-division-i|publisher=NCAA|access-date=March 9, 2016|date=March 8, 2016}}</ref> However, Turner allowed the tournament's closing theme, ''[[One Shining Moment]]'', to be played for the 30th year in a row. To date, the song is still played in this manner, no matter which network airs the National Championship game.

For 2016, the selection show on CBS was expanded into a two-hour broadcast—a move which proved unpopular with viewers due to the decreased speed at which the participating teams were unveiled. These issues were exacerbated by a [[Internet leak|leak]] of the full bracket shortly into the broadcast, which spread on [[Twitter]]. Although ratings for the selection show had steadily decreased over the past four years, the 3.7 overnight rating for the broadcast was the lowest in 20 years.<ref name="wp-ssratings">{{cite news|title=Ratings for CBS's NCAA tournament selection show were almost as bad as show itself|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/03/14/ratings-for-cbss-ncaa-tournament-selection-show-were-almost-as-bad-as-show-itself/|date=March 14, 2016|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref><ref name="lat-twohour">{{cite news|title=NCAA says it's investigating the bracket leak that saved us from the two-hour Selection Sunday show|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-ncaa-tournament-bracket-leak-20160314-story.html|date=March 14, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> CBS Sports chairman Sean McManus admitted that the extended special was a failure, stating that "we haven't had any specific discussions but I think we all agree it would serve all of us well including the fan to release the brackets in a little more timely manner".<ref name="wp-2032extend">{{cite news|title=CBS and Turner Sports lock down NCAA tournament through 2032|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/04/12/cbs-and-turner-sports-lock-down-ncaa-tournament-through-2032/|access-date=April 12, 2016|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 12, 2016}}</ref>
