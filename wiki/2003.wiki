The '''2003 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 65 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 18, 2003, and ended with the [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 7 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] at the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Superdome]]. A total of 64 games were played.

The Final Four consisted of [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], making its second straight appearance; [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]], making its first appearance since they won the national championship in 1977; [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]], making its first appearance since 1996; and [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]], making its first appearance since 1947. Texas was the only top seed to advance to the Final Four; the other three (Arizona, Kentucky, and Oklahoma) advanced as far as the Elite Eight but fell.

Syracuse won its first national championship in three tries under 27th-year head coach [[Jim Boeheim]], who would ultimately retire after the 2022–2023 season. This was also [[Roy Williams (basketball coach)|Roy Williams]]’s final game as Kansas head coach; he would depart after the season to become the head coach at [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]].

===BYU bracketing switch===
When the bracket was first revealed, it contained a mistake that would have forced BYU, a Mormon-run school, to play its potential Elite 8 game on a Sunday, which is against school policy. As a solution, the selection committee had a plan to switch BYU, the 12 seed in the Friday-Sunday South regional, with the team that reached the Sweet 16 in the Thursday-Saturday Midwest regional (either Wisconsin, Weber State, Dayton, or Tulsa) should the Cougars advance to the Sweet 16.<ref name="BYU">{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/ncaatourney03/story?id=1524804|title=BYU would switch regionals if it wins two|last=Katz|first=Andy|date=March 16, 2003|work=ESPN.com|access-date=April 16, 2022}}</ref> BYU lost its first-round game to Connecticut, which meant no switches were necessary.

===National semifinals===
*April 5, 2003
**[[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] (E3) 95, [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]] (S1) 84
*:Freshman [[Carmelo Anthony]] scored 33 points leading the [[Syracuse University|Syracuse Orangemen]] past the [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas Longhorns]] in the night cap of the national semifinal doubleheader. Syracuse opened up a comfortable 2nd half lead, but that was trimmed to four with just 1:08 remaining. However, freshman [[Gerry McNamara]] iced the game with clutch foul shooting in the final minutes. The win put Syracuse and coach [[Jim Boeheim]] one win away from their first ever National Championship. Texas was the last number one seed remaining in the tournament.<ref name="CNNSI4.5-1">{{cite web|work=CNN Sports Illustrated|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2003/04/05/5151_recap.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031017215122/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2003/04/05/5151_recap.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 17, 2003|title=2003 NCAA National semifinals: (E3) Syracuse 95, (S1) Texas 84|access-date=2008-03-06}}</ref>

*April 7, 2003
**[[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] (E3) 81, [[University of Kansas|Kansas]] (W2) 78
*: Leading up to the championship game, much of the conversation revolved around how, no matter the outcome, one of the well-known head coaches would win their first championship.<ref name="Wojciechowski">{{cite web |url =http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/ncaatourney03/columnist?id=1534793&name=wojciechowski_gene |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20030604083305/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/ncaatourney03/columnist?id=1534793&name=wojciechowski_gene |url-status =dead |archive-date =June 4, 2003 |title =Boeheim, Williams say title won't define careers |last =Wojciechowski |first =Gene |date =April 6, 2003 |website =ESPN.com |publisher =ESPN the Magazine |access-date =November 16, 2013}}</ref> In Jim Boeheim's 27 years as head coach at Syracuse his team had been to two previous Final Fours, and finished runner-up each time ([[1987 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1987]], [[1996 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1996]]).<ref name="Wojciechowski"/>   Roy Williams, during his fifteen seasons as Kansas head coach, had reached the Final Four three previous times, and finished runner up once ([[1991 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1991]]).<ref name="Wojciechowski"/>  Syracuse dominated with a hot shooting first half to lead by 11 at the break. Gerry McNamara connected on an impressive six [[three-pointers]] in the half, which were his 18 points for the game. Kansas fought back to within 80–78 in the final minute and had a chance to tie after [[Hakim Warrick]] missed a pair of [[free throws]] in the final moments; free throws were a major problem throughout the game for Kansas, who went 12-for-30 in attempts. Warrick then blocked Michael Lee's three point attempt with 1.5 seconds remaining on the game clock, followed by Kirk Hinrich's three-pointer at the buzzer going over the net. Kansas' free throw struggles would prove costly in giving Syracuse and Jim Boeheim their first ever national championship. Carmelo Anthony was named [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] (MOP) with 20 points and 10 Rebounds in the win. Syracuse also avenged a second-round loss to Kansas [[2001 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|two years earlier]].<ref name="CNNSI4.7">{{cite web|work=CNN Sports Illustrated|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2003/04/07/5154_recap.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030605101239/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2003/04/07/5154_recap.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 5, 2003|title=2003 NCAA national championship: (E3) Syracuse 81, (W2) Kansas 78|access-date=2008-03-06}}</ref>

==Broadcast information==
Originally, CBS Sports was to have shown all 63 games of the tournament following the opening round, which was on [[ESPN]]. However, because of the start of the [[Iraq War]] the night before, the afternoon games on Thursday and Friday were moved to ESPN while retaining CBS graphics and production. CBS News then joined other broadcast and non-broadcast outlets in showing [[media coverage of the Iraq War|extended news coverage]].

Thursday and Friday night's games were shown on CBS, albeit with frequent [[CBS News|news updates]]. To make up for lost advertising revenue, an additional time slot was opened the following Sunday evening for more CBS telecasts.

2003 also marked the debut of Mega March Madness as an exclusive package on [[DirecTV]]. This offered additional game broadcasts not available to the viewer's home market during the first three rounds of the tournament. All games from the 4th round (Elite Eight) onward were national telecasts.

[[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] had exclusive national radio coverage.
