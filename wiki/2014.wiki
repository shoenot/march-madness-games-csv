The '''2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament''' involved 68 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] that determined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[College basketball|basketball]] national champion for the [[2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2013-14 season]]. The 76th annual edition of the tournament began on March 18, 2014, and concluded with the [[2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|championship game]] on April 7, at [[AT&T Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]].

The East Regional semifinals and final were held in [[Madison Square Garden]], the first time that arena has been used as an NCAA Tournament venue and the first time in 63 years that tournament games have been held in New York City.

The Final Four consisted of [[2013–14 Florida Gators men's basketball team|Florida]] (the #1 overall seed of the tournament), making their first appearance since winning their [[2006–07 Florida Gators men's basketball team|second consecutive championship in 2007]], [[2013–14 UConn Huskies men's basketball team|UConn]], returning after winning their [[2010–11 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|2011 national championship]], [[2013–14 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]], making their first appearance since [[1999–2000 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|2000]], and [[2013–14 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], back in the Final Four after winning their [[2011–12 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|2012 national championship]].

With No. 7 seed [[2013-14 UConn Huskies men's basketball team|UConn]] and No. 8 seed [[2013-14 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] reaching the championship game, this tournament's final was the first ever not to include at least one team seeded 1–3. It is also only the third final not to feature a 1 or 2 seed ([[1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|1989]]{{Snd}} #3 [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] vs. #3 [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall]] and [[2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game|2011]]{{Snd}} #3 [[UConn Huskies men's basketball|UConn]] vs. #8 [[Butler Bulldogs men's basketball|Butler]]). UConn defeated Kentucky in the championship game 60–54, to claim their 4th national championship as in many attempts. UConn was also the first 7 seed ever to reach and win the championship game. The two teams combined for the highest seed total in championship game history with 15. The previous record (11) was held by UConn and Butler in 2011.

The next day, the [[UConn Huskies women's basketball|UConn Huskies women's team]] won the [[2014 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament|women's NCAA basketball tournament]], only the second time that a school has won both the men's and women's Division I national basketball championships in the same year; UConn first accomplished this in 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/tournament/2014/story/_/id/10753064/connecticut-huskies-welcome-home-men-champions-celebrate-women-title |title=Party continues with title sweep |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=April 9, 2014}}</ref>

==Tournament procedure==
{{further|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Current tournament format}}

For 2014 the selection committee picked a total of 68 teams that would enter the 2014 tournament, of which 32 were "automatic bids" (teams winning their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournaments, with the exception of the [[Ivy League]], which does not host a post-season conference tournament; thus, its regular-season conference champion is awarded the automatic bid) while the remaining 36 were "at large" bids which were extended by the NCAA Selection Committee on the Sunday preceding the First Four play-in tournament and dubbed ''[[NCAA basketball tournament selection process#Selection Sunday|Selection Sunday]]'' by the media and fans.  The [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marchmadness2014.net/betting-system-a-few-simple-tips-for-betting-on-the-ncaa-tournament/|title=運営者情報 - 一押し、旬！ドキ|website=www.marchmadness2014.net|access-date=2014-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319041015/http://www.marchmadness2014.net/betting-system-a-few-simple-tips-for-betting-on-the-ncaa-tournament/|archive-date=2014-03-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Eight teams – the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams – played in the ''First Four'' (the successor to what had been popularly known as "[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Opening Round game|play-in games]]" through the 2010 tournament).  The winners of those games advanced to the main draw of the tournament.

==Tournament notes==
[[2013–14 Wichita State Shockers men's basketball team|Wichita State]] became the first team since UNLV in 1991 to go into the tournament undefeated. The Shockers entered the tournament 34–0. Their perfect record of 35–0 (a then NCAA men's record) was spoiled by [[2013-14 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] in the second round. Kentucky in turn set an NCAA-men's-record 38 straight wins to start a season the next year.

Kentucky became the first team to field all-freshman starters at the Final Four and championship games since the 1991–92 Michigan Wolverines under the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/kentuckys-five-freshman-looking-to-separate-themselves-from-michigans-fab-five.html|title=Kentucky's Five Freshman Looking to Separate Themselves From Michigan's Fab Five|last1=Strauss|first1=Ben|date=2014-03-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-07|last2=Gerstner|first2=Joanne C.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The 1992 Final Four and championship appearances by Michigan were subsequently vacated.

For only the second time since 1973 no teams from the state of Indiana (a state noted for its basketball powerhouse programs) were in the tournament.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/sports/ncaabasketball/for-indiana-land-of-hoops-no-shot-in-ncaa-tournament.html?_r=0 |title=For Land of Hoops, No Shot in N.C.A.A.

There were five overtime games in the second round of the tournament, the most overtime games ever in tournament history. In contrast, the previous two tournaments had two overtime games combined.

[[2013–14 North Dakota State Bison men's basketball team|North Dakota State]]'s victory against [[2013–14 Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball team|Oklahoma]] secured the first tournament win for the state of [[North Dakota]]. [[2013–14 Mercer Bears men's basketball team|Mercer]], [[2013–14 Stephen F. Austin Lumberjacks basketball team|Stephen F. Austin]], [[2013–14 Albany Great Danes men's basketball team|Albany]], and Cal Poly had their first NCAA tournament wins. Cal Poly's victory over Texas Southern marked only the third time a team with a losing record won a game in the tournament.

===Upsets===
Per the NCAA, "Upsets are defined as when the winner of the game was seeded five or more places lower than the team it defeated." The 2014 tournament saw a total of 13 upsets; 6 of them were in the first round, 4 of them were in the second round, none in the Sweet Sixteen, one in the Elite Eight, and 2 in the Final Four.
