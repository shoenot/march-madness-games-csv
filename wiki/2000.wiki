The '''2000 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 16, 2000, and ended with the [[2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 3 in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] at the [[RCA Dome]]. A total of 63 games were played.

Due to a string of upsets throughout the tournament, only one top-four seed advanced to the Final Four. That was [[1999–2000 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]], who finished the season as the #2 team in the nation and was given the top seed in the Midwest Region. The highest seeded of the other three Final Four teams was [[1999–2000 Florida Gators men's basketball team|Florida]], who won the East Region as the fifth seed. Two eight-seeds made the Final Four, with [[1999–2000 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]] and [[1999–2000 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] rounding the bracket out. Wisconsin won the West Region while North Carolina won the South Region, with both regions seeing their top three seeds eliminated during the first weekend of play.

Michigan State won their first national championship since 1979 by defeating Florida 89–76 in the final game. [[Mateen Cleaves]] of Michigan State was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]], while [[Morris Peterson]] was its leading scorer.

Despite the string of upsets, no seed lower than 11 won a game in the tournament. The only 11 seed to win was [[Pepperdine Waves men's basketball|Pepperdine]], which defeated [[1999–2000 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana]] in the East Region's first round in what turned out to be [[Bob Knight]]'s last game coaching the Hoosiers before his firing that offseason. Also, two teams that qualified as 10 seeds advanced to the Sweet Sixteen as [[1999–2000 Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball team|Seton Hall]] in the East and [[1999–2000 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gonzaga]] in the West both advanced.

Because of the upsets, the Elite Eight consisted of one top seed (Michigan State), one second seed ([[1999–2000 Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team|Iowa State]]), one third seed ([[1999–2000 Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball team|Oklahoma State]]), one fifth seed (Florida), one sixth seed ([[1999–2000 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|Purdue]]), one seventh seed ([[1999–2000 Tulsa Golden Hurricane men's basketball team|Tulsa]]), and two eighth seeds (Wisconsin and North Carolina). This is the most recent title won by the Big Ten Conference.

==Final Four==
At [[RCA Dome]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]

===National semifinals===
*April 1, [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]] (M1) 53, [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]] (W8) 41
*:In the first half it appeared that the Cinderella run of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin Badgers]] had a great chance of continuing. Wisconsin's slow down offense, smothering defense tempo held the game to a [[Michigan State University|Michigan State Spartans]] 19–17 lead. However, the only number one seed left in the tournament opened the second half with a 13–2 run, including 10 points from senior [[Morris Peterson]]. After the run, Michigan State coasted home against Wisconsin's limited offense.<ref name="CNNSI4.1-1">{{cite web|work=CNN Sports Illustrated|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2000/04/01/may_wbg/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011122204820/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2000/04/01/may_wbg/|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 22, 2001|title= 2000 NCAA National semifinals: (MW1) Michigan State 53, (W8) Wisconsin 41|access-date=2008-03-06}}</ref>
**[[University of Florida|Florida]] (E5) 71, [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]] (S8) 59
*:Despite being behind 18–3 to start the game and trailing at halftime, the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina Tar Heels]] took control of the early minutes of the second half, and managed to sneak ahead 48–42 on standout freshman guard [[Joseph Forte]]'s second consecutive three-pointer with 15:44 to play. However, the [[University of Florida|Florida Gators]] answered back with a 9–0 run to give them the lead for good. The Gators held the Tar Heels to just six points over a 9{{sfrac|1|2}} minute span to put them in great shape. Foul trouble ultimately doomed the Tar Heels, and the Gators advanced to their first ever National Championship game.<ref name="CNNSI4.1-2">{{cite web|work=CNN Sports Illustrated|publisher=CNNSI.com |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2000/04/01/fak_nav/ |title=2000 NCAA National semifinals: (E5) Florida 71, (S8) North Carolina 59 |access-date=2008-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326231735/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2000/04/01/fak_nav/ |archive-date=26 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Championship game===
{{main|2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game}}
*April 3, 2000
**Michigan State (M1) 89, Florida (E5) 76
*:Michigan State senior [[Mateen Cleaves]] limped his way to the [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] (MOP) of the 2000 NCAA Tournament. Cleaves sprained his ankle with 16:18 to play in the 2nd half, and this was after Florida had trimmed Michigan State's double digit halftime lead to 50–44. Cleaves returned about four minutes later, and immediately helped lead the Spartans on a 16–6 run to put the game out of reach. The lone top-seed remaining would bring order to a tournament filled with upsets as they salted away the victory for the school's second national championship ([[1979 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1979]]). Michigan State coach [[Tom Izzo]] earned his first and only title, from his second straight final four appearance. Morris Peterson led the Spartans with 21 points.<ref name="CNNSI4.3">{{cite web|work=CNN Sports Illustrated|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2000/04/03/may_fak/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010519131323/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2000/04/03/may_fak/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 19, 2001|title=2000 NCAA national championship: (MW1) Michigan State 89, (E5) Florida 76|access-date=2008-03-06}}</ref>
