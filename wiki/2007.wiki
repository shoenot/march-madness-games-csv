The '''2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament''' involved 65 teams playing in a [[single-elimination tournament]] that determined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[College basketball|basketball]] national champion for the [[2006–07 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2006-07 season]]. The 69th annual edition of the tournament began on March 13, 2007, with the [[NCAA men's Division I basketball opening round game|opening round game]] and concluded with the [[2007 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 2, at the [[Georgia Dome]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref name = bracket>[http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/brackets/viewable/2007 2007 NCAA Basketball Men's Viewable Brackets – NCAA.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Both of the finalists from the year before returned to the Final Four as [[2006–07 Florida Gators men's basketball team|Florida]], who returned its entire starting lineup from the year before, and [[2006–07 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA]] advanced. They were joined in the Final Four by [[2006–07 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]], who was making its first appearance since their [[1999 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1999 appearance]] (later vacated), and [[2006–07 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]], appearing for the first time since their [[1984–85 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|national runner-up]] finish in [[1985 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1985]].

Florida successfully defended their title by defeating Ohio State in the championship 84–75. This marked the second time in [[2007 in sports|2007]] that a Florida team beat an Ohio State team to win a national championship, as [[2006 Florida Gators football team|Florida's football team]] won the [[2007 BCS National Championship Game|BCS National Championship Game]] over [[2006 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] in January. Florida's [[Corey Brewer]] was named the [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].<ref name="espnchamp">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160915005631/http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=274000063 ESPN – Ohio State vs. Florida Recap, April 02, 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Florida became the first team to repeat since [[1991–92 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] in [[1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1992]], and were the seventh school to repeat overall.<ref name="espnchamp" /> The 2007 Gators were the last team to repeat as national champions until the [[2023–24 UConn Huskies men's basketball team|UConn Huskies]] repeated as national champions in [[2024 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2024]].

This tournament was notable because it featured significantly fewer upsets than prior years. There were only 12 games in which a lower-seeded team defeated a higher-seeded team, and eight of these "upsets" were by teams ranked only one seed lower than their opponent. As of 2024, this is the last tournament in which no team seeded 12 or lower won a round of 64 game, while No. 7-seed [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|UNLV]] was the lowest-seeded team to make it to the Sweet Sixteen. This marked the second time since the tournament expanded to 64 teams that no team seeded No. 8 or lower played in the Sweet Sixteen; the other instance was in [[1995 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1995]]. [[2007 Southland Conference men's basketball tournament|Southland Conference champion]] [[Texas A&M–Corpus Christi Islanders men's basketball|Texas A&M-Corpus Christi]] made their first NCAA appearance.

This was the first Tournament since [[2003 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|2003]] that regional sites were designated as "East", "West", "South", and "Midwest", rather than by the names of the host cities.

==Tournament procedure==
A total of 65 teams entered the tournament. Of that total, 30 of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their [[List of NCAA conferences|conference]] tournaments. The automatic bid of the [[Ivy League]], which did not conduct a post-season tournament, went to its regular season champion, [[Penn Quakers men's basketball|Penn]]. The remaining 34 teams were granted "at-large" bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.

The initial game on March 13 officially named the [[NCAA men's Division I basketball opening round|opening round game]], but popularly called the "play-in game", had [[Niagara Purple Eagles men's basketball|Niagara]], winner of the [[MAAC men's basketball tournament|Mid-Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament]], facing [[Florida A&M Rattlers basketball|Florida A&M]], who won the [[2007 MEAC men's basketball tournament|Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament]], for a chance to play top seed [[2006–07 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] in the first round of the Tournament. Niagara defeated Florida A&M, 77–69, to advance to play Kansas.

All teams are seeded 1 to 16 within their regionals, while the [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|Selection Committee]] seeded the entire field from 1 to 65.

===Opening rounds===
{{main|2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament opening rounds}}

====First round upsets, close games, and other facts====
The two major upsets of the first round were #11 Virginia Commonwealth's win over #6 Duke (West Regional), and #11 Winthrop's win over #6 Notre Dame (Midwest Regional). VCU beat Duke, 79–77, on a shot by Eric Maynor with 1.8 seconds left, sending Duke out for the first time in the first round since 1996. Winthrop's highly touted offense built a 21-point second-half lead before surviving a late Notre Dame rally to win, 74–64, earning their first tournament victory in school history. The only overtime game of the first round was in the South Regional, between #7 Nevada and #10 Creighton, ending 77–71 in favor of the Nevada Wolf Pack. Other close games included #3 Oregon squeaking by #14 Miami (Ohio), 58-56 (Midwest Regional), #5 Virginia Tech's win over #12 Illinois 54-52 (West Regional), and #9 Xavier's win over #8 BYU, 79-77 (South Regional). The highest score accumulated by a team in the 2007 tournament went to Tennessee's 121 points over Long Beach State (South Regional), which set a school record. This was the first year since 1993 that a #10 seed did not advance to the second round. It was also only the second time in the last 17 years that a #12 seed failed to advance against a #5 seed. #15 Texas A&M-Corpus Christi had leads of 10-0 and 25–7 in the first half against the #2 Wisconsin Badgers but Wisconsin prevailed 76–63.<ref name="ESPNScores3.15">{{cite web|author=ESPN|author-link=ESPN|work=ESPN.com|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/scoreboard?confId=100&date=20070315|title=NCAA tournament first round Scores: Day One-3/15/07|access-date=2008-02-29}}</ref><ref name="ESPNScores3.16">{{cite web|author=ESPN|author-link=ESPN|work=ESPN.com|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/scoreboard?confId=100&date=20070316|title=NCAA tournament first round Scores: Day Two-3/16/07|access-date=2008-02-29}}</ref>

====Second round upsets, close games, and other facts====
The two biggest upsets of the second round were #6 Vanderbilt's win over #3 Washington State (East Regional) and #7 UNLV's win over #2 Wisconsin (Midwest Regional). Vanderbilt won a heart-stopper, 78–74, in double overtime. UNLV won by six points, 74–68, in their biggest win since the 1990s. Other overtime games included #1 Ohio State's 78–71 win over #9 Xavier (South Regional) and #3 Pittsburgh's 84–79 overtime victory over #11 Virginia Commonwealth (West Regional). Ohio State's [[Ron Lewis (basketball)|Ron Lewis]] hit a three-pointer with two seconds remaining to force overtime against Xavier, and Pittsburgh fought Virginia Commonwealth's comeback from 19 points down to come up with the victory. The Ohio State win over Xavier had a controversial ending as prior to Lewis's game-tying shot, Buckeye Greg Oden shoved a Xavier player, Justin Cage, in the back and onto the floor. Had an intentional foul been called, Xavier would have been awarded two foul shots and ball possession. Instead, a regular personal foul was called. Subsequently, Xavier missed the second free throw, allowing Lewis to shoot the game-tying 3.<ref>[http://outofbounds.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/xavier/ The New York Times "Out of Bounds" blog]</ref> Other close games were #3 Texas A&M winning over #6 Louisville, 72-69 (South Regional); #5 Butler's victory over #4 Maryland, 62-59 (Midwest Regional); and #5 Tennessee defeating #4 Virginia, 77-74 (South Regional). This tournament marked the first time since 1995 that a double-digit seeded team did not advance to the Sweet 16 (Midwest #7 seed UNLV was the lowest team in the Sweet 16).<ref name="ESPNScores3.17">{{cite web|author=ESPN|author-link=ESPN|work=ESPN.com|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/scoreboard?confId=100&date=20070317|title=NCAA tournament second round Scores: Day One-3/17/07|access-date=2008-02-29}}</ref><ref name="ESPNScores3.18">{{cite web|author=ESPN|author-link=ESPN|work=ESPN.com|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/scoreboard?confId=100&date=20070318|title=NCAA tournament second round Scores: Day Two-3/18/07|access-date=2008-02-29}}</ref>

====Regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen) upsets, close games, other facts====
No upsets or overtime games occurred in this round of the tournament, although there were several very close games. In the South Region, #2 Memphis barely defeated #3 Texas A&M as Aggie senior [[Acie Law IV|Acie Law]], after a solid performance for most of the game, missed an open layup with under a minute left.

After a tight first-half, the Bruins slowly put away the top-seeded Jayhawks in the second-half using their 2006 national championship game experience, along with a strong defense. Shooting percentage was a key factor in the game as UCLA shot 53% to Kansas's 41%. UCLA's [[Arron Afflalo]] led all scorers with 24 points while [[Brandon Rush]] of Kansas led the Jayhawks with 18.

North Carolina led for most of the game and the entire second half, but Georgetown rallied from ten points down with six minutes remaining to force overtime. The Tar Heels were outscored 15–3 in the extra session, missing 22 of their final 23 field goal attempts. Georgetown reached its first Final Four since 1985, when John Thompson III's father [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson (Jr.)]] was coach—and Thompson III became the first coach to succeed his father in coaching a team to the Final Four. With North Carolina's loss in the regional final, this marked the first time since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams that no ACC team made it to the Final Four for two consecutive years. The last time that no ACC team made it to the Final Four in consecutive years was in 1979 and 1980.

In what was actually a close game for most of regulation, Florida's three-point shots, along with a 20–9 run in the second half, amounted to a Gator win.

===Final Four===
[[File:NewGeorgiaDome.JPG|thumb|200px|The [[Georgia Dome]] was the site of the Final Four and National Championship in 2007.]]
All of the 2007 Final Four teams had participated in the 2006 tournament. Ohio State was knocked out in the second round by Georgetown, who would lose to Florida in the Minneapolis Regional semifinals. Florida would go on to defeat UCLA in the championship game. The four teams were all previous champions as well—Ohio State (1960), Georgetown (1984), UCLA (several), and Florida (2006)—marking the fourth time that all of the Final Four teams were past champions (joining [[1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1993]], [[1995 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1995]] and [[1998 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament|1998]] Final Fours). Also, it was the first time in nine years that no two Final Four teams were from the same conference.

A rematch of a regular season meeting, won 86–60 by Florida in Gainesville, The Gators survived 25 points and 12 rebounds from Buckeyes center [[Greg Oden]] with stellar play from guards [[Lee Humphrey]] and [[Taurean Green]] with inside contributions coming from [[Al Horford]] (18 points) and tourney Most Outstanding Player [[Corey Brewer]]. [[Billy Donovan]] became the third-youngest coach (at age 41) to win two titles. Only Bob Knight (at Indiana) and [[University of San Francisco|San Francisco]]'s [[Phil Woolpert]] both won two titles at the age of 40.

The Gators are the first team ever to hold the NCAA Division I college football and basketball titles in the same academic year (2006–07) and calendar year (2006 and 2007). Coincidentally, Florida also beat Ohio State (by a score of 41–14) in the [[2007 BCS National Championship Game|College Football Championship]], the first time in college sports history that identical matchups and results have occurred in both football and basketball championships. This was also the first time in NCAA D-I men's basketball history that exactly the same starting five were able to win back-to-back titles ([[Joakim Noah]], [[Corey Brewer]], [[Lee Humphrey]], [[Al Horford]], [[Taurean Green]]). Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA Tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47. Humphrey surpassed [[Bobby Hurley]]'s record of 42.

[[Greg Gumbel]] once again served as the studio host, joined by analysts [[Clark Kellogg]] and [[Seth Davis]].

====Other television====
[[CBS College Sports Network|CSTV]], owned by [[CBS]], telecast the George Washington-Vanderbilt and the Virginia-Albany contests (in addition to the local CBS affiliates nearest to the participating teams in those games, and those using their [[digital subchannel]]s for [[simulcast]]ing). Those games served as the first-ever live tourney telecasts on CSTV, which also provided a highlights show after each day of competition. <!--West Coast affiliates do not automatically receive any games starting in the late afternoon about 2 p.m. PT, contrary to an earlier posting; KCBS in Los Angeles opted to air The Price is Right after the national first-session games, for example.-->

For the first three rounds of the tournament, games were also shown on [[DirecTV]] through the Mega March Madness [[pay-per-view]] service and on [http://www.ncaasports.com/mmod/ March Madness on Demand], a [[broadband]] [[Internet]] [[video streaming]] service that was a joint venture between [[CBSSports.com|CBS SportsLine]] (now known as CBSSports.com) and the NCAA.

The opening round game was broadcast on [[ESPN]] for the sixth consecutive year.

===Radio===
[[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] once again had the live radio coverage. Kevin Harlan once again served as the play-by-play man at the Final Four with Bill Raftery and [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]] on color. Thompson the elder is the father of current Georgetown coach John Thompson III.<ref name="CBSSportsPairings" />

==Basketball courts==
During the first- and second-round games in New Orleans, as part of the continuing [[Reconstruction of New Orleans|recovery process]] from [[Hurricane Katrina]], the NCAA allowed an additional floor decal recognizing the work of [[Habitat for Humanity International#Collegiate Challenge|Habitat for Humanity's Collegiate Challenge]] and the NCAA Home Team program through the subregional's host institution, [[Tulane University]]. This marked the first time that a logo other than that of the NCAA or an NCAA member school has been allowed at an NCAA-sanctioned championship event. In addition, Tulane student athletes and athletic department personnel built a new house, valued at $75,000 ([[United States dollar|US]]), which was paid for by the NCAA and their corporate partner [[Lowe's]], on Girod Street between the [[New Orleans Arena]], site of the games, and the [[Louisiana Superdome]], which has hosted four Final Fours.<ref>http://www.ncaasports.com/story/10062095 Tulane teams with Habitat with Humanity March 15, 2007</ref>

Also, for the first time, custom-made, identical courts were used at all four regional sites in San Jose, St. Louis, San Antonio and East Rutherford. Starting in 2010, all tournament games would have the same identical courts.
