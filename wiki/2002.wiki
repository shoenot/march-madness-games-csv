The '''2002 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 65 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 12, 2002, and ended with the [[2002 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on April 1 in [[Atlanta]] at the [[Georgia Dome]]. A total of 64 games were played.

This was the first year that the tournament used the so-called "pod" system, in which the eight first- and second-round sites are distributed around the four regionals. Teams were assigned to first round spots in order to minimize travel for as many teams as possible. The top seeds at each site were:

*[[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]: [[University of Oregon|Oregon]] (M2), [[University of Southern California|USC]] (S4)
*[[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]: [[University of Arizona|Arizona]] (W3), [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] (W4)
*[[Dallas]]: [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] (W2), [[Mississippi State University|Mississippi State]] (M3)
*[[St. Louis]]: [[University of Kansas|Kansas]] (M1), [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]] (E4)
*[[Chicago]]: [[University of Georgia|Georgia]] (E3), [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign|Illinois]] (M4)
*[[Pittsburgh]]: [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]] (W1), [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] (S3)
*[[Washington, D.C.]]: [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]] (E1), [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut]] (E2)
*[[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]]: [[Duke University|Duke]] (S1), [[University of Alabama|Alabama]] (S2)

The Final Four consisted of [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland]], making their second consecutive appearance, [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], making their first appearance since 1993, [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]], making their first appearance since 1992, and [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]], making their first appearance since their national runner-up finish in 1988.

Maryland defeated Indiana 64–52 in the championship game to win their first-ever national championship. [[Juan Dixon]] of Maryland was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]].

For the second straight tournament, the Elite Eight featured at least one double-digit seed. South Region tenth-seed [[Kent State Golden Flashes men's basketball|Kent State]] and West Region twelfth-seed [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri]] played in their respective regional finals, with Kent State losing to Indiana and Missouri losing to Oklahoma. This also marked the first time since 1987 that no team from the states of North Carolina nor Kentucky reached the Final Four.

This tournament was the first since [[1974 NCAA Division I basketball tournament|1974]] (the last tournament which only allowed one team per conference) in which the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]] were not a participant. The 27-year streak was, at the time, the longest appearance streak in NCAA history, having beaten [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]'s 15-year streak in 1990. It has since been topped by [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], whose 35-year streak dates back to 1990 and is still active.  (Two other active teams, [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] and [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]], also have active 20 year streaks and could beat UNC's streak in 2026 and 2027, respectively.)

*March 30, 2002
**[[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]] (E1) 97, [[University of Kansas|Kansas]] (M1) 88
*:For the second straight year the [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland Terrapins]] earned a bid to the Final Four. This time they would take advantage of their trip. After falling behind 13–2 to the [[University of Kansas|Kansas Jayhawks]] to begin the game, Maryland stormed to a 44–37 lead at halftime. They expanded their lead to 20, 83–63, with 6:11 left in the game. [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]]' Kansas squad did not quit and closed the gap to 4 with under a minute remaining, but the Terps survived to advance to the championship, 97–88. Maryland senior [[Juan Dixon]] led the contest in scoring with 33.<ref name="CNNSI3.30-1">{{cite web|work=CNN Sports Illustrated|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2002/03/30/maj_kaa/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606040957/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2002/03/30/maj_kaa/|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 6, 2002|title=2002 NCAA National semifinals: (E1) Maryland 97, (MW1) Kansas 88|access-date=2008-03-06}}</ref>

*:[[Mike Davis (basketball coach)|Mike Davis]]'s [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana Hoosiers]] continued their Cinderella ride in the NCAA tournament by defeating another higher ranked team, the [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma Sooners]]. Oklahoma led most of the first half, and took a 34–30 lead into halftime. However, with the score 60–60 late in the 2nd half Indiana broke ahead for good with an easy bucket from [[Jeff Newton]], who led the Hoosiers with 19 points. The Hoosiers outscored the Sooners by 13 in the 2nd half and advanced to the championship game with a 73–64 victory. Oklahoma was coached by [[Kelvin Sampson]], who later in his career would succeed Davis as IU head coach.<ref name="CNNSI3.30-2">{{cite web|work=CNN Sports Illustrated|publisher=CNNSI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2002/03/30/oae_iai/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020401222209/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2002/03/30/oae_iai/|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 1, 2002|title=2002 NCAA National semifinals: (S5) Indiana 73, (W2) Oklahoma 64|access-date=2008-03-06}}</ref>

Ohio State vacated all 32 games including its NCAA Tournament appearance from the 2001–02 season due to the [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1950)#Firing controversy|Jim O’Brien scandal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=2362496|title=OSU gets probation|date=2006-03-10|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-06-05}}</ref> Unlike forfeiture, a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win, only with Ohio State removing the wins from its own record.
