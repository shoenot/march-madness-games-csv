The '''1999 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 11, 1999, and ended with the [[1999 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on March 29 at [[Tropicana Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. A total of 63 games were played. This Final Four was the first—and so far, only—to be held in a [[baseball]]-specific facility, as Tropicana Field is home to the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] (then known as the Devil Rays).

The Final Four consisted of [[1998–99 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|Connecticut]], making their first ever Final Four appearance; [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]], making their ninth Final Four appearance and first since 1968; [[1998–99 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]], making their third Final Four appearance and first since their 1979 national championship; and [[1998–99 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]], the overall number one seed and making their first Final Four appearance since losing the national championship game in 1994.

In the national championship game, Connecticut defeated Duke 77–74 to win their first ever national championship, snapping Duke's 32-game winning streak, and scoring the biggest point-spread upset in Championship Game history. Duke nonetheless tied the record for most games won during a single season, with 37, which they co-held until [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky's]] 38-win seasons in [[2011–12 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|2011–12]] and [[2014–15 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|2014–15]]. The [[2007–08 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team|2007–08 Memphis]] team actually broke this record first, but the team was later forced to vacate their entire season due to eligibility issues surrounding the team.

[[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard "Rip" Hamilton]] of Connecticut was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. This was a significant victory for the program, as it cemented Connecticut's reputation as a true basketball power after a decade of barely missing the Final Four.

This tournament is also historically notable as the coming-out party for [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]] as a rising [[mid-major]] power. Gonzaga has made every NCAA tournament since then, and is now generally considered to be a high-major program despite its mid-major [[West Coast Conference|conference affiliation]]. Gonzaga is expected to join the newly revamped [[Pac-12 Conference]] in 2026.

Due to violations committed by Ohio State head coach [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1949)|Jim O'Brien]], the Buckeyes were forced to vacate their appearance in the 1999 Final Four.<ref>[[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1949)#Firing controversy|Jim O'Brien{{Snd}} Firing controversy]] (references included)</ref>

==Additional notes==
* Despite their loss in the finals to Connecticut, the 1998–1999 Duke team won 37 games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Men's College Basketball 1998–1999 Chi Square Linear WL – SD |url=http://www.phys.utk.edu/sorensen/cfr/cfr/CBM/1998/CBM_1998_Ranking_sCWS.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828172244/http://www.phys.utk.edu/sorensen/cfr/cfr/CBM/1998/CBM_1998_Ranking_sCWS.html |archive-date=2008-08-28 |url-status=live |access-date=2009-04-06 }}</ref>  This tied them with [[1985–86 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke's 1985–86 team]], [[1986–87 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV's 1986–87 squad]], and later, [[2004–05 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team|Illinois' 2004–05 team]] and [[2007–08 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas's 2007–08 team]], for the most wins in a season, until their record was broken by the 38-win [[2007–08 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team|Memphis]] team in 2007–08.  However, as the NCAA vacated Memphis' 2007–2008 season due to the ineligibility of [[Derrick Rose]], they reclaimed the 37-win record. The mark would once again be raised to 38 wins after [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky's]] dominant title run in 2012, which then tied with Kentucky's 2014–15 team.  Only one of the first 5 teams to be the winningest single-season teams won a national championship; UNLV's squad lost in the national semifinal to [[1986–87 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana]], and the other teams lost in the finals, to [[1985–86 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]], [[1998–99 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|UConn]], and [[2004–05 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]], while Kansas defeated Memphis in the 2008 national championship game.  Kentucky's 2014–15 squad suffered their only loss that season in the national semifinal to [[2014–15 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]].
* Connecticut's victory in the finals marks the biggest upset in Championship Game history in the NCAA tournament, as they were 9.5-point underdogs in the contest despite having compiled a 33–2 record going into the Championship game, including a 14–2 record in the tough Big East Conference.  In fact, Connecticut had spent more weeks as the number 1 team in the country, according to the AP Top 25 Poll, than had Duke. The previous record was held by [[1984–85 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]], who defeated [[1984–85 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] as 9-point underdogs in 1985.<ref name="pointspread">{{cite web |url=http://www.goldsheet.com/gs_new/histcbb.php |title=Gold Sheet College Basketball Log |access-date=29 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410131625/http://www.goldsheet.com/gs_new/histcbb.php |archive-date=10 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
* The 1999 Final Four would be the last time Tropicana Field would host NCAA tournament games. For Duke, they had 2 straight promising seasons end on the Tropicana Field floor, with an 86–84 loss to Kentucky in the 1998 South Regional final, and then the 1999 National Championship game.
* North Carolina lost to Weber State which marked the first time the Tar Heels had lost in the first round of the expanded field era with 64 or more teams.
* This is the only tournament in which all four 7-seeds lost in the first round to their 10-seeded opponents.
