The '''1998 [[NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament]]''' involved 64 schools playing in [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] play to determine the national champion of men's  [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]]. It began on March 12, 1998, and ended with the [[1998 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|championship game]] on March 30, at the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio]]. A total of 63 games were played.

The Final Four consisted of [[1997–98 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], making their third consecutive Final Four, [[1997–98 Stanford Cardinal men's basketball team|Stanford]], making their first appearance since their initial Final Four run in 1942, [[1997–98 Utah Utes men's basketball team|Utah]], making their fourth Final Four and first since 1966, and [[1997–98 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]], who returned for a fourteenth overall time and third in four seasons.

Kentucky won the national title, its second in three seasons and seventh overall, by defeating Utah 78–69 in the championship game.

[[Jeff Sheppard]] of Kentucky was named the tournament's [[NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]]. Kentucky came back from double-digit deficits in each of its last three games in the tournament, including a 17-point second half comeback against the Duke Blue Devils, leading to the school's fans dubbing the team the "Comeback Cats". This was Kentucky's third straight championship game appearance.

[[Bryce Drew]] led the 13th-seeded [[1997–98 Valparaiso Crusaders men's basketball team|Valparaiso Crusaders]] to the Sweet Sixteen, including [[The Shot (Ole Miss–Valparaiso)|a memorable play that remains part of March Madness lore]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.ncaa.com/news/ncaa/marchmadness75/2012-12-10/ncaa-honors-all-time-greats-part-75-years-march-madness-celebrat | website = [[NCAA]] | date = December 11, 2012 | title = NCAA honors all-time greats as part of 75 years of March Madness celebration | access-date = April 4, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195928/http://www.ncaa.com/news/ncaa/marchmadness75/2012-12-10/ncaa-honors-all-time-greats-part-75-years-march-madness-celebrat | archive-date = March 4, 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

For the second consecutive season, a #14 seed advanced from the first round; [[Richmond Spiders men's basketball|Richmond]], coached by [[John Beilein]], upset South Carolina.

For the second time in three years, a top seeded team failed to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. That distinction belonged to Midwest Region #1 seed [[1997–98 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], who was defeated by #8 seed [[1997–98 Rhode Island Rams men's basketball team|Rhode Island]].

All of Michigan's wins from the 1997–98 season were vacated on November 7, 2002, as part of the settlement of the [[University of Michigan basketball scandal]].  Unlike forfeiture, a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win, only with the removal of any Michigan wins from all records.
