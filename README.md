## March Madness Men's Tournament Individual Game Results

I couldn't find a source which had each individual March Madness game in a tabular format, 
so I decided to compile that data into CSV files myself, for easy analysis in with R. 

All of the code for the data extraction from wikipedia comes from 
[danvk/march-madness-data](https://github.com/danvk/march-madness-data), with fixes 
from [caycehouse/march-madness-data](https://github.com/caycehouse/march-madness-data).
This would've taken significantly longer without their work, so all credit goes to them. 

I will try to keep the data up to date, but in the event that I forget, you can simply clone the repo, 
install the requirements, and run getpages.sh and generate_files.py.
